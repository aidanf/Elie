ALL RESUMES ARE HELD IN COMPLETE CONFIDENCE.  RESUMES ARE NEVER SENT TO A CLIENT UNLESS WE HAVE TALKED TO YOU AND HAVE YOUR EXPRESS PERMISSION TO SEND THE RESUME TO OUR CLIENT.  ALL POSITIONS ARE FEE PAID BY THE CLIENT.  

Clients pay us fees (not applicants) to find EXPERIENCED technical people.  They GENERALLY do NOT request recent degreed professionals to fill a job order.  Clients expect recent graduates to find their first job on their own.  We recommend that recent graduates target the companies and specific p
eople that they want to work for with a cover letter, a resume and then follow up with a phone call..
