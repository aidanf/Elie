<purchabr>AMOCO</purchabr> {<purchcode>AN</purchcode>} MAY BUY <acqabr>DOME</acqabr> {<acqcode>DMP</acqcode>}, REPORT SAYS
    Toronto, April 17 - <purchaser>Amoco Corp</purchaser> is apparently the successful
bidder for debt-laden <acquired>Dome Petroleum Ltd</acquired>, according to a
published report.
    The Toronto Globe and Mail, quoting sources close to the
negotiations, today said <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> broke off talks last night with
TransCanada PipeLines Ltd, which last week announced a 4.3
billion Canadian dlr offer for all of <acqabr>Dome</acqabr>'s assets.
    No financial details about the <purchabr>Amoco</purchabr> offer were available
and a <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> spokesman would neither confirm nor deny that <purchabr>Amoco</purchabr>
had emerged the winner, the newspaper said.
    However, the <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> spokesman indicated that the sale of <acqabr>Dome</acqabr>
could be finalized and announced this weekend, the Globe and
Mail said.
    Representatives of <purchabr>Amoco</purchabr> were not immediately available for
comment.
    Last Sunday, when TransCanada announced its offer, <acqabr>Dome</acqabr>
said it was also in talks with two other companies, but refused
to identify them.
    Since then, market speculation has centered on <purchabr>Amoco</purchabr> and
Exxon Corp's {XON} 70 pct-owned Imperial Oil Ltd subsidiary in
Canada.
    British Petroleum PLC {BP} and Royal Dutch/Shell Group {RD}
have also been mentioned as possible suitors for <acqabr>Dome</acqabr>.
    In the past two days, <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> management has been pressured by
the federal government to select the offer from TransCanada,
the only Canadian company in the bidding.
    Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's government appears to want
to avoid a <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> sale to a foreign company since the government
gave <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks to
encourage oil and gas exploration in the Arctic, analysts and
officials have said.
    A purchase by TransCanada would be least likely to run
afoul of Canadian antitrust laws, however, TransCanada is
asking for tax concessions from a federal government that is
trying to hold its deficit below 30 billion Canadian dlrs,
analysts have said.
    A takeover by <purchabr>Amoco</purchabr> or Imperial would also give a foreign
oil company a dominant position in Canada's oil industry.
    Imperial Oil is already Canada's largest energy company,
with 1986 revenues of 7.1 billion Canadian dlrs. Chicago-based
<purchabr>Amoco</purchabr> had 1986 revenues of 20.23 billion U.S. dlrs. Its <purchabr>Amoco</purchabr>
Canada Petroleum subsidiary is 100 pct owned by <purchaser>Amoco Corp</purchaser>.
