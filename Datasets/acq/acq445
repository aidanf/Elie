NEW ZEALAND PRESS GROUP BUYS MORE TEXAS NEWSPAPERS
    WELLINGTON, March 17 - {<purchaser>Independent Newspapers Ltd</purchaser>} (<purchabr>INL</purchabr>)
said it <status>bought</status> two more <acqbus>community newspapers</acqbus> in <acqloc>Houston, Texas</acqloc>,
through a subsidiary there, for an <dlramt>undisclosed sum</dlramt>.
    <purchabr>INL</purchabr> said in a statement {<purchaser>Houston Community Newspapers Inc</purchaser>}
bought the <acquired>South West Advocate</acquired> and the <acquired>South Bend Advocate</acquired>,
with combined circulation of 74,000 copies, and associated
assets, from {<seller>The Advocate Communications Corp Inc</seller>}.
    <purchabr>INL</purchabr> publishes Wellington's morning and evening newspapers
as well as New Zealand provincial dailies and newspapers in
Rhode Island. Just under 40 pct of <purchabr>INL</purchabr> is owned by {News Ltd},
an Australian subsidiary of News Corp Ltd {NCPA.S}.
    Production and administration of the two publications would
be transferred to the company's existing centre in Houston. <purchabr>INL</purchabr>
said the acquisition took effect on March 1.
    <purchabr>INL</purchabr> chairman Alan Burnet said the purchase would enable the
subsidiary to offer advertisers a combined distribution of nine
community newspapers to 340,000 homes in the greater Houston
area. Trading conditions in the area are particularly difficult
because the city's economy depends to a large extent on the
fortunes of the petroleum industry, but the situation should
improve in the medium to long term and the investment will
prove to be sound, he said.
