GROUP MAY SUPPORT <acquired>CARDIS CORP</acquired> {<acqcode>CDS</acqcode>} BUYOUT
    WASHINGTON, June 29 - A group of companies controlled by
<purchaser>Brookehill Partners Inc</purchaser> told government authorities it may
support a buyout of <acquired>Cardis Corp</acquired> as a way to maximize the value
of the company's stock.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
the group disclosed that it currently holds a 5.5 pct stake in
<acqabr>Cardis</acqabr> common stock, and said it "would likely support" an
acquisition of the company as a whole or in parts by another
party, terming such a move "the most likely means for the
company's shareholders to maximize the value of their
investment."
    Although the group characterized its <acqabr>Cardis</acqabr> stock holdings
as principally for investment, it said it intends to contact
third parties who might be interested in an acquisition of
<acqabr>Cardis</acqabr>, a <acqloc>Los Angeles</acqloc>-based <acqbus>auto parts</acqbus> distributor.
    The group added its has already had "some contacts" with
others concerning the company, but said no understandings have
been reached.
    "The (<acqabr>Cardis</acqabr>) common shares continue to offer opportunity
for price appreciation on the basis of the company's asset
value and earnings momentum," the <purchabr>Brookehill</purchabr> group told the
SEC.
    The group, which currently holds 318,900 <acqabr>Cardis</acqabr> common
shares, consists of New York-based Brookehill Partners and its
two subsidiaries, Brookehill Equities Inc, a brokerage, and
Moore, Grossman and deRose Inc, an investment advisor. Walter
Grossmman, S. Edward Moore and Robert deRose, all of New York,
each own one-third interests in Brookehill Partners.
    Since April 27, members of the <purchabr>Brookehill</purchabr> group made net
purchases of 6,000 <acqabr>Cardis</acqabr> common shares at approximately 4 dlrs
a share. The group told the SEC it may continue to purchase
additional <acqabr>Cardis</acqabr> stock, but also reserved the right to sell
its shares in the company.
