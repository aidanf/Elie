<acqabr>GAF</acqabr> {<acqcode>GAF</acqcode>} GROUP RECONSIDERS BUYOUT BID
    WAYNE, N.J., Oct 19 - <acquired>GAF Corp</acquired> said the management group
led by chairman <purchaser>Samuel J. Heyman</purchaser> intends to <status>reconsider</status> its
proposal to acquire <acqabr>GAF</acqabr>.
    On September 8, the group offered 64.00 dlrs in cash and
2.50 dlrs principal amount of 15 pct junior subordinated
debentures due 2007 for each <acqabr>GAF</acqabr> share.  <purchabr>Heyman</purchabr> owns about
2,700,000 of <acqabr>GAF</acqabr>'s 33.5 mln shares outstanding.
    In a letter to the committee of independent directors
formed to consider the offer, <purchabr>Heyman</purchabr> said it will have to
modify the terms of the offer if it is to continue the bid, due
to rising interest rates and financial market conditions.
    <purchabr>Heyman</purchabr> said "In the considerable time that has elapsed
since our original proposal was submitted, the credit and
financial markets have experienced extraordinary and almost
unprecedented deterioration.  As of the present time, the
average interest rate on the financing which we proposed to
raise in connection with the acquisition has increased, since
the original proposal, by approximately 150 basis points."
    He said the group intends to promptly review all available
options, including the revision of its offer to reflect current
market conditions.
