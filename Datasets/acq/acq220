<sellerabr>EDELMAN GROUP</sellerabr> CUTS <acqabr>BURLINGTON</acqabr> {<acqcode>BUR</acqcode>} STAKE
    WASHINGTON, June 1 - New York investor <seller>Asher Edelman</seller> and
<seller>Dominion Textile Inc</seller> {<sellercode>DTX.T</sellercode>}, who are currently seeking to
acquire <acquired>Burlington Industries Inc</acquired> in a hostile tender offer,
said they <status>lowered their stake</status> in the company.
    In a filing with the Secruties and Exchange Commission, the
<sellerabr>Edelman/Dominion group</sellerabr>, known as <seller>Samjens Acqusition Corp</seller>, said
it sold options to buy 258,800 <acqabr>Burlington</acqabr> common shares,
reducing its stake in the company to 3,408,813 shares, or 12.33
pct, from 3,667,313 shares, or 13.3 pct.
    The group said the sale, which represented all the
<acqabr>Burlington</acqabr> options it owned, was made May 28 for 8.7 mln dlrs.
    The <sellerabr>Edelman/Dominion group</sellerabr> last week sweetened its hostile
tender offer to 77 dlrs a share, after <acqabr>Burlington</acqabr> agreed to a
leveraged buyout by a Morgan Stanley and Co-backed group for 76
dlrs a share.
    But the <sellerabr>Edelman/Dominion group</sellerabr>, which has litigation
pending against <acqabr>Burlington</acqabr>, also said it has held talks with
Morgan Stanley about "the possibility of settlement of
outstanding matters among" it, Morgan Stanley and <acqabr>Burlington</acqabr>.
