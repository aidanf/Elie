    SYDNEY, March 30 - {<purchaser>BTR Nylex Ltd</purchaser>} said it will <status>increase
its takeover offer</status> for <seller>Borg-Warner Corp</seller>'s {<sellercode>BOR</sellercode>} listed unit,
{<acquired>Borg-Warner (Australia) Ltd</acquired>} (<acqabr>BWA</acqabr>) to five dlrs each from four
dlrs for all issued ordinary and preference shares.
    The new offer values the <acqbus>diversified auto parts
manufacturer</acqbus>'s 27.22 mln ordinary shares and 13.22 mln first
participating preference shares at <dlramt>202.2 mln dlrs</dlramt>.
    Formal documents will be sent to shareholders as soon as
possible, it said in a brief statement.
    <purchabr>BTR Nylex</purchabr>, which manufactures rubber and plastic products,
first bid for <acqabr>BWA</acqabr> in late January.
    As previously reported, <seller>Borg-Warner Corp</seller>, which owns 65 pct
of <acqabr>BWA</acqabr>'s ordinary shares and 100 pct of the preferences,
advised a month ago that it would not accept the offer.
    This meant <purchabr>BTR Nylex</purchabr>'s 50.1 pct acceptance condition could
not be met, <acqabr>BWA</acqabr> said in a statement reporting its parent's
decision.
    <acqabr>BWA</acqabr> advised shareholders to ignore the offer and said other
parties had expressed interest in bidding for it.
    But no other bid has yet emerged.
    <purchabr>BTR Nylex</purchabr> is a 59.5 pct-owned listed subsidiary of
Britain's BTR Plc {BTRX.LON}.
