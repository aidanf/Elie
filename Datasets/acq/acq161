TAKEOVER BATTLE FOR <acqabr>DOME PETROLEUM</acqabr> BEGINS
    By Solange De Santis, Reuters
    TORONTO, April 13 - A <status>takeover battle</status> began today for
debt-burdened <acquired>Dome Petroleum Ltd</acquired> {<acqcode>DMP.MO</acqcode>} as <purchaser>TransCanada
PipeLines Ltd</purchaser> {<purchcode>TRP.TO</purchcode>} announced a <dlramt>4.3 billion dlr</dlramt> offer and
<acqabr>Dome</acqabr> said it is <status>continuing talks with other possible buyers</status>.
    Companies mentioned in market speculation as potential
buyers for <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> include Imperial Oil Ltd {IMO.A} which is 70
pct owned by Exxon Corp {XON.N}, {PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd}
which is 87 pct owned by the conglomerate Canadian Pacific Ltd
{CP.N} and British Petroleum Co Plc {BP.L}.
    Along with the <purchabr>TransCanada</purchabr> offer, <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> has had another
proposal from "a substantial company" and discussions with a
third company which could lead to an offer, <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> said in a
statement.
    The statement confirmed <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> received <purchabr>TransCanada</purchabr>'s bid,
but did not identify the companies involved in talks.
    <purchabr>TransCanada</purchabr>, Canada's largest natural gas pipeline
operator, said it is offering <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> a package of cash, common
and preferred shares, and shares in a new subsidiary which
would own and operate <acqabr>Dome</acqabr>'s assets. <purchabr>TransCanada</purchabr> said the offer
is to <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> management, not to shareholders.
    <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> has massive <acqbus>oil and gas</acqbus> landholdings in <acqloc>Canada</acqloc>,
totalling 36.1 mln acres of which 7.4 mln have been developed.
It also has tax credits worth about 2.5 billion dlrs.
    <acqabr>Dome</acqabr>'s statement said the <purchabr>TransCanada</purchabr> announcement "violated
the terms and spirit of a confidentiality agreement entered
into with prospective purchasers" and was apparently timed to
prevent Dome from considering other proposals.
    It said the <purchabr>TransCanada</purchabr> bid "seems to require favourable and
substantial taxation concessions from the federal and
provincial governments." But <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> added that its management and
financial advisers will evaluate all proposals.
    <purchabr>TransCanada</purchabr> chief financial officer H. Neil Nichols said he
was surprised at the vehemence of <acqabr>Dome</acqabr>'s statement and denied
that <purchabr>TransCanada</purchabr> was trying to usurp other bids. "I find (<acqabr>Dome</acqabr>'s
statement) very bothersome. Once the board made the decision to
authorise the proposal, it had a legal obligation to announce
it," he said. Nichols said he did not know the identity of the
other bidders, or the terms of other offers.
    <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> common shares closed at 1.13 dlrs on Friday on the
Toronto Stock Exchange. The preferred class A stock closed at
5.00 dlrs. Common stock traded as high as 25.00 dlrs in 1981.
