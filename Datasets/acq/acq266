<acqabr>DATACARD</acqabr> {<acqcode>DATC.O</acqcode>} ADOPTS DIVIDEND RIGHTS PLAN
    MINNEAPOLIS, June 29 - <acquired>DataCard Corp</acquired> said it adopted a
dividend rights plan in response to <seller>Deluxe Check Printers Inc</seller>
{<sellercode>DLX</sellercode>} having <status>agreed</status> to sell its 38 pct interest in <acqabr>DataCard</acqabr> to
<purchaser>National Computer Systems Inc</purchaser> {<purchcode>NLCS.O</purchcode>}.
    <acqabr>DataCard</acqabr> declared a dividend distribution of one preferred
stock purchase right on each outstanding share its common
stock. The dividend is designed to deter <purchabr>National Computer</purchabr> or
other potential suitors from preventing <acqabr>DataCard</acqabr> from
evaluating all alternatives to maximize shareholder value,
<acqabr>DataCard</acqabr> said.
   
    <purchabr>National Computer</purchabr> told Reuters June 22 it could make a bid
for <acqabr>DataCard</acqabr>. On June 25 <acqabr>DataCard</acqabr> filed suit in Hennepin County
District Court in Minnesota to block the sale of the 38 pct
stake of its stock to <purchabr>National Computer</purchabr>.
    In announcing the rights plan, <acqabr>DataCard</acqabr> said it "is not
designed to deter takeovers that would be consistent with the
objective of maximizing stockholders value to all of <acqabr>DataCard</acqabr>'s
stockholders."
    The rights will not become exercisable until 10 days after
an announcement that a person or group has acquired beneficial
ownership of 44 pct or more of <acqabr>DataCard</acqabr>'s common stock.
   
    Once exercisable, each right would entitle a holder to buy
1/500th of a share of <acqabr>DataCard</acqabr> Series A junior participation
preferred Stock for 35 dlrs. Holders other than an acquirer
would be entitled to purchase, for six-months after the right
becomes exercisable, a number of shares of the new preferred
stock with a market value equal to twice the exercise price of
the rights.
    The rights dividend distribution is payable July 9 to
shareholders of record July 9.
