<purchabr>SQUIBB</purchabr> {<purchcode>SQB</purchcode>} SAID NOT INTERESTED IN BUYING <acqabr>CETUS</acqabr>
    BY MARJORIE SHAFFER, REUTERS
    NEW YORK, June 18 - Robert Fildes, president and chief
executive of <acquired>Cetus Corp</acquired> {<acqcode>CTUS.O</acqcode>}, told Reuters that <purchaser>Squibb Corp</purchaser>
is <status>not interested in buying</status> <acqabr>Cetus</acqabr>.
    Earlier the companies said <purchabr>Squibb</purchabr> would buy from <acqabr>Cetus</acqabr> a
five pct equity postion in <acqabr>Cetus</acqabr> for about 40 mln dlrs.
    "This is not an attempt by <purchabr>Squibb</purchabr> to become a major
majority holder in <acqabr>Cetus</acqabr>," Fildes told Reuters in an interview.
"<purchabr>Squibb</purchabr> has not approached us with any indication that they
want to acquire us and we wouldn't be interested in that kind
of arrangement," said Fildes.
    <purchabr>Squibb</purchabr> could not be reached to comment on the late comments
by Fildes.
    <purchabr>Squibb</purchabr> is <acqabr>Cetus</acqabr>' first pharmaceutical partner and the only
one to own an equity position in <acqabr>Cetus</acqabr>. Eastman Kodak Co {EK}
and W.R. Grace {WR} both have joint ventures with <acqabr>Cetus</acqabr>, but
neither owns an equity position in the company, said Fildes.
    <acqabr>Cetus</acqabr> has a venture with Kodak to develp diagnostic
products and with Grace to develop agricultural products.
    Earlier, <purchabr>Squibb</purchabr> and <acqabr>Cetus</acqabr> announced in a joint statement 
an agreement in principle to form a joint venture to develop
new biotechnology products in several fields.
   
    As part of the deal <purchabr>Squibb</purchabr> will license several of <acqabr>Cetus</acqabr>'
anticancer agents, including interleukin-2, in development.
<purchabr>Squibb</purchabr> will sell the drugs only in Japan and other markets but
not in North American and Western Europe.
    "We wouldn't have done this deal had it not been understood
that <acqabr>Cetus</acqabr> wants to build its own fully integrated business in
North America and Europe," said Fildes.
    He said <purchabr>Squibb</purchabr> was the good partner because <purchabr>Squibb</purchabr> has a
major joint venture in Japan and has sales capabilities of its
own in that market.
   
    Fildes said <acqabr>Cetus</acqabr> has shunned licensing arrangements with
pharmaceutical companies because it wanted to build its own
business. Many large corporations have invested in small
biotech firms.
    But <purchabr>Squibb</purchabr>'s investment in <acqabr>Cetus</acqabr> is the first it has made
in biotechnology. Fildes said that was attractive to <acqabr>Cetus</acqabr>
because it wanted a partner that didn't have a relationship
with a large number of other biotechnology companies."
   
    Fildes said his strategy was to have partners in non drug
areas like diagnostics and agriculture, but to "keep the
biggest developments in anticancer drugs to ourselves."
    Fildes said the partnership with <purchabr>Squibb</purchabr> would be used to
broaden the company's reach in such big money making areas
as the cardiovascular, anti-infective and the anti-inflammatory
markets.
    <purchabr>Squibb</purchabr> is also investming 75 mln dlrs in <acqabr>Cetus</acqabr>' research
over the next five years.
   
    "<purchabr>Squibb</purchabr> is putting up over 75 mln dlrs in research and
development to make it happen, while the equity position part
of the package is simply to demonstrate the seriousness of this
partnership," said Fildes.
