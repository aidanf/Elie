<acqabr>HUGHES TOOL</acqabr> {<acqcode>HT</acqcode>} UP ON MERGER SPECULATION
    NEW YORK, March 6 - <acquired>Hughes Tool Co</acquired> rose one to 12-1/4 on
1,658,000 shares, apparently reflecting a belief that <purchaser>Baker
International Corp</purchaser> {<purchcode>BKO</purchcode>} will be able to persaude <acqabr>Hughes</acqabr> to go
along with a previously announced merger, analysts said.
    This week <acqabr>Hughes</acqabr> seemed to back out of the merger but then
said it was still interested in talking.
    "It sounds like <purchabr>Baker</purchabr> wants it and if people are convinced
a deal is going to go through the stock goes up," said analyst
Phil Pace of Kidder, Peabody and Co. Holders of <acqabr>Hughes</acqabr> would
get 0.8 share of <purchabr>Baker</purchabr> for each <acqabr>Hughes</acqabr> share.
