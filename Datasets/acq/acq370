possibility of seeking control of it.
    <purchabr>Lindner</purchabr>, the Cincinnati, Ohio, investor who controls

managers and directors have been aimed at "achieving an
increased ownership position" in the company.
    <purchabr>Lindner</purchabr> said his increase in ownership would be made either
by making an offer to acquire control of <acqabr>Taft</acqabr> or taking part in
a group to acquire the company.
    <purchabr>Lindner</purchabr>, who holds his <acqabr>Taft</acqabr> stake through American
Financial and its subsidiaries, said he is also considering
buying more <acqabr>Taft</acqabr> stock on the open market or in private deals.
    He did not say whether the talks with <acqabr>Taft</acqabr> officials led to
any agreements or understandings.
    But <purchabr>Lindner</purchabr> said he intends to review his investment in
<acqabr>Taft</acqabr> and may be involved in further talks or take other steps
regarding the future control and direction of <acqabr>Taft</acqabr>.

pct, after buying 49,800 shares for a total of 5.8 mln dlrs.
    Although he recently received clearance from the Federal
Trade Commission to raise his stake in the company to 24.9 pct,
<purchabr>Lindner</purchabr> in previous SEC filings has always stressed that his
interest in <acqabr>Taft</acqabr> was for investment only and not was not
seeking to control the company.
