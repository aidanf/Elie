CANADA STOCKS/<acquired>DOME PETROLEUM LTD</acquired> {<acqcode>DMP</acqcode>}
    TORONTO, April 13 - <acquired>Dome Petroleum Ltd</acquired> shares moved higher
in the U.S. and Canada after <purchaser>TransCanada PipeLines Ltd</purchaser> {<purchcode>TRP</purchcode>}
made a <dlramt>4.3 billion Canadian dlr</dlramt> bid for <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> and <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> said it
is in talks with two other unidentified companies.
    Market speculation is that the other two potential bidders
are not Canadian companies and DuPont's {DD} Conoco and
Atlantic Richfield Co {ARC} are mentioned as possibilities,
Wilf Gobert of Peters and Co Ltd said.
    <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> rose 1/4 to 1-1/8 on the American Stock Exchange.
<purchabr>TransCanada PipeLines</purchabr> was down 1/4 at 15-3/4 on the New York
Stock Exchange.
    <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> was the most active stock on the Toronto exchange at
1.50 dlrs per share, up 37 cts.
    Gobert characterized the market action in <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> as "awfully
optimistic" but said investors are hoping for a competing offer
to the shareholders.
    <purchabr>TransCanada PipeLines</purchabr>' offer is to <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> management, not to
shareholders. However, it proposes issuing new equity in a
subsidiary that would operate <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> assets. Current <acqabr>Dome</acqabr>
shareholders would own 20 pct of the new subsidiary.
