<sellerabr>GOODYEAR</sellerabr> {<sellercode>GT</sellercode>} TO SELL <acqabr>CELERON</acqabr>
    AKRON, Ohio, April 13 - <seller>Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co</seller> said it
<status>expects to sell</status> its <acquired>Celeron Corp</acquired> <acqbus>oil and gas</acqbus> subsidiary for
about <dlramt>two billion dlrs</dlramt> in about two months.
    After the company's annual meeting, Rober Mercer,
<sellerabr>Goodyear</sellerabr>'s chairman and chief executive officer, also said 
<sellerabr>Goodyear</sellerabr> expects to report a profit of more than one dlr a
share from continuing operations in the first quarter. In the
same year-ago period, <sellerabr>Goodyear</sellerabr> reported a loss of 64 cents a
share from continuing operations.
    Mercer said about seven companies are interested in buying
<acqabr>Celeron</acqabr> and they may form a consortium to buy the unit.
    <acqabr>Celeron</acqabr> consists of <acqbus>oil and gas</acqbus> reserves and an almost
complete pipeline linking drilling operations in Santa Barbara,
Calif., to Texas refineries. Mercer said <acqabr>Celeron</acqabr>'s reserves
would not be sold separately from the pipeline.
    Concerning speculation that <dlramt>two billion dlr</dlramt> price tag for
<acqabr>Celeron</acqabr> was too high, Mercer said "There is no fire sale going
on here and we can continue to keep <acqabr>Celeron</acqabr> as a profitable
operation throughout the year."
    Mercer said the expected 1st quarter operating profit was
based on the new share total after <sellerabr>Goodyear</sellerabr>'s share repurchase
last year to fend off Sir James Goldsmith's hostile takeover
bid.
