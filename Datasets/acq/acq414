    LOS ANGELES, March 13 - <acquired>Caesars World Inc</acquired> said its board
unanimously <status>rejected</status> a 28 dlr a share takeover offer by New
York investor <purchaser>Martin T. Sosnoff</purchaser>.
    <acqabr>Caesars</acqabr> said <purchabr>Sosnoff</purchabr>'s offer to by all its outstanding
shares of common stock was inadequate and not in the best
interests of its shareholders.
    The company recommended that shareholders reject <purchabr>Sosnoff</purchabr>'s
offer, made through his {MTS Acquisition Corp}, and not tender
any of their shares.
    <acqabr>Caesars</acqabr> said it will explore a variety of alternative
transactions but did not elaborate.
    <acqabr>Caesars</acqabr>, in a brief statement, did not say whether it would
seek to buy back its shares held by <purchabr>Sosnoff</purchabr>.
    A <acqabr>Caesars</acqabr> spokesman said the company would not comment
further on its decision.
    On Wednesday, <purchabr>Sosnoff</purchabr> told the Securities and Exchange
Commission that he controls 13.6 pct of the company's stock.
    <purchabr>Sosnoff</purchabr> also informed the SEC that <acqabr>Caesars</acqabr> had offered to
buyout his holdings several times during the past year.
    No one from the <purchabr>Sosnoff</purchabr> organization was immediately
available for comment.
    <acqabr>Caesars</acqabr> said its financial advisor, Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc, had determined that <purchabr>Sosnoff</purchabr>'s offer was financially
inadequate for shareholders other than <purchabr>Sosnoff</purchabr>.
    The company said other factors it considered in rejecting
the offer were its financial condition, future prospects,
current market conditions and the numerous conditions on which
<purchabr>Sosnoff</purchabr>'s bid was conditioned.
    <acqabr>Caesars</acqabr>' stock opened up 1/8 point at 28-1/8. That is 1/8
point above <purchabr>Sosnoff</purchabr>'s offer price.
