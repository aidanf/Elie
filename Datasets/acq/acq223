<purchabr>EQUITICORP TASMAN</purchabr> TO BID FOR <acqabr>MONIER LTD</acqabr>
    SYDNEY, June 2 - {<purchaser>Equiticorp Tasman Ltd</purchaser>} (<purchabr>ETL</purchabr>) said it <status>will
offer</status> 4.15 dlrs a share cash for all the issued capital of
<acquired>Monier Ltd</acquired> {<acqcode>MNRA.S</acqcode>}, currently the subject of a 3.80 dlrs a
share bid by CSR Ltd {CSRA.S}.
    Alternatively, <purchabr>ETL</purchabr> will offer three shares plus 82 cents
cash for each <acqabr>Monier</acqabr> share, it said in a statement.
    As previously reported, <purchabr>ETL</purchabr> moved into the market for
<acqabr>Monier</acqabr> shares last week, taking its stake to 13.7 pct by
Friday.
    It now holds 14.99 pct, the maximum allowed without Foreign
Investment Review Board (FIRB) approval. <purchabr>ETL</purchabr> is classified as
foreign because of its New Zealand base.
    The <purchabr>ETL</purchabr> cash offer values <acqabr>Monier</acqabr>'s issued capital of 156.28
mln shares at 649 mln dlrs, against 593 mln for the CSR bid.
    Based on the current price of <purchabr>ETL</purchabr> shares of 1.05 dlrs, the
alternative is worth 3.97 dlrs per share, but <purchabr>ETL</purchabr> said the
value placed on its shares for the offer aproximates to the
diluted asset backing of <purchabr>ETL</purchabr> as at March 31.
    <purchabr>ETL</purchabr> said the offer will have no minimum acceptance
conditions and will be subject to Australian foreign investment
and U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino anti-trust clearances.
    <purchabr>ETL</purchabr> chairman Allan Hawkins said in the statement that the
shareholding in <acqabr>Monier</acqabr> was a long term investment.
    <purchabr>ETL</purchabr> and its {Feltex International Ltd} associate have
targetted the <acqbus>building products</acqbus> sector as an area of expansion
and <acqabr>Monier</acqabr> fits well with this aim, he added.
    <acqabr>Monier</acqabr> chairman Bill Locke said in a separate statement
that the independent directors of <acqabr>Monier</acqabr> intend to recommend
acceptance of the <purchabr>ETL</purchabr> bid in the absence of a higher bid.
    He also said <acqabr>Monier</acqabr> will not now proceed with the
one-for-two bonus issue announced with its interim results on
March 19 in view of the proposed takeover bids.
    As previously reported, the CSR offer involves a complex
put and call option deal with <acqabr>Monier</acqabr>'s major shareholder,
Redland Plc {RDLD.L}, which gives Redland the choice of
accepting the CSR offer for its 49.8 pct stake or moving to
50.1 pct within six months of the bid closing.
    CSR officials have made it clear that they see Redland
taking the second option, resulting in the two companies
running <acqabr>Monier</acqabr> as a joint venture.
    CSR officials have also said they had no intention of
raising the company's bid for <acqabr>Monier</acqabr> after <purchabr>ETL</purchabr>'s intervention
became public last week.
