SORO GROUP TO LIMIT <acqabr>FAIRCHILD</acqabr> {<acqcode>FEN</acqcode>} STOCK BUYS
    WASHINGTON, April 21 - <purchaser>Quantum Fund N.V.</purchaser>, a Netherlands
Antilles mutual fund for which New York investor George Soros
is investment adviser, said it has <status>agreed to limit</status> further
purchases of <acquired>Fairchild Industries Inc</acquired> stock.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
<purchabr>Quantum</purchabr>, which already holds 1,647,481 <acqabr>Fairchild</acqabr> common shares,
or 11.5 pct of the total outstanding, said it agreed to the
restriction after <acqabr>Fairchild</acqabr> said its security clearance might
be jeopardized if <purchabr>Quantum</purchabr> acquires a major stake in it.
    But <purchabr>Quantum</purchabr> said <acqabr>Fairchild</acqabr> management was told that Soros,
acting either individually or through entities other than
<purchabr>Quantum</purchabr> that he controls, may decide to buy common stock in the
company on his own behalf.
    <purchabr>Quantum</purchabr> had recently notified the Federal Trade Commission
under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976
that it might buy up to 49.9 pct of <acqabr>Fairchild</acqabr>'s voting stock.
Unless the FTC had objected, <purchabr>Quantum</purchabr> would have been free, but
not obligated, to buy up to 49.9 pct of <acqabr>Fairchild</acqabr> stock.
    <acqabr>Fairchild</acqabr> management, however, warned that if <purchabr>Quantum</purchabr>, a
foreign entity, raises its stake in the company to 49.9 pct, it
could "impair" the government security clearances <acqabr>Fairchild</acqabr>
needs to carry out its its defense contract work.
    In response, <purchabr>Quantum</purchabr> said it told <acqabr>Fairchild</acqabr> it will not
make "significant additional purchases" of its common or
preferred stock without giving <acqabr>Fairchild</acqabr> enough prior notice to
enable it to consult with <purchabr>Quantum</purchabr> over the impact of action.
    <purchabr>Quantum</purchabr> also said it has withdrawn its notification request
to the FTC and the antitrust division of the Justice Department
of its intent to buy up to 49.9 pct of <acqabr>Fairchild</acqabr>.
    <purchabr>Quantum</purchabr> also said it told the FTC and the Justice
Department that it does not expect to resubmit any further
notifications of intent to significantly raise its stake in
<acqabr>Fairchild</acqabr> at this time.
    The restrictions <purchabr>Quantum</purchabr> has agreed to follow regarding
further dealings in <acqabr>Fairchild</acqabr> stock do not apply to Soros as an
individual investor.
     <acqabr>Fairchild</acqabr>'s annual shareholders meeting is scheduled to be
held tomorrow.
