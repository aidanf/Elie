<acqabr>INSTINET</acqabr> {<acqcode>INET</acqcode>} SETS MEETING ON MERGER
    NEW YORK, March 12 - <acquired>Instinet Corp</acquired> said its board has
scheduled a special shareholders' meeting for May 21 to vote on
its <status>proposed</status> merger into <purchaser>Reuters Holdings PLC</purchaser> {<purchcode>RTRSY</purchcode>}.
    It said shareholders of record as of April 10 will be
eligible to vote at the meeting.
    <acqabr>Instinet</acqabr> said the meeting date is subject to adjustment,
based on the length of time needed for the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission to complete its review of the filing of
merger proxy materials, which <acqabr>Instinet</acqabr> expects to make before
the end of March.
    <acqabr>Instinet</acqabr> said the filing of the preliminary merger proxy
materials is tied to the finalization of audited financial
statements of Instinet and Reuters for 1986.
    Under a merger agreement entered into in November, <purchabr>Reuters</purchabr>
tendered for up to 5.10 mln Instinet common shares, or about 45
pct of those not already owned by <purchabr>Reuters</purchabr>. As a result of the
tender, <purchabr>Reuters</purchabr> now owns about 49 pct of <acqabr>Instinet</acqabr> shares.
    In the merger, holders of remaining <acqabr>Instinet</acqabr> shares will
receive 8.50 dlrs of Reuters American Depositary Shares for
each <acqabr>Instinet</acqabr> share.
    The ADS's will be valued at the average of their closing
prices in the 10 trading days before the effective date of the
merger.
    <acqabr>Instinet</acqabr> said it expects the merger to become effective as
soon as possible after shareholder approval at the special
meeting.
