    WASHINGTON, March 26 - <purchaser>USAir Group Inc</purchaser> said the U.S.
Department of Transportation has issued an order allowing it to

Aviation Inc</acquired> shares <purchabr>USAir</purchabr> is seeking in its current 69 dlr per
share tender offer.
    The company said the new order supersedes an order issued
by the department last Friday that would have required <purchabr>USAir</purchabr> to
sell within one week of expiration of the tender any <acqabr>Piedmont</acqabr>
shares it held in excess of 51 pct of the <acqabr>Piedmont</acqabr> stock then
outstanding.
    The company said the 9,309,394 <acqabr>Piedmont</acqabr> shares, together
with the 2,292,599 <acqabr>Piedmont</acqabr> shares already owned by <purchabr>USAir</purchabr>,
constitute about 50.1 pct of Piedmont's shares on a
fully-diluted basius but about 61.0 pct of shares currently
outstanding.
    The shares are to be held in a voting trust pending the
department's review of <purchabr>USAir</purchabr>'s application to obtain control of
<acqabr>Piedmont</acqabr>.
