<purchaser>AUSTRALIAN GAS LIGHT CO</purchaser> COUNTER-BIDS FOR <acqabr>TMOC</acqabr>
    SYDNEY, April - {<purchaser>The Australian Gas Light Co</purchaser>} (<purchabr>AGL</purchabr>) said it
<status>will offer</status> one share plus one dlr cash for every two shares in
oil and gas producer {<acquired>TMOC Resources Ltd</acquired>} in a counter-bid to
the previously reported takeover offer by Santos Ltd {STOS.S}.
    The offer values <acqabr>TMOC</acqabr> shares at 4.75 dlrs each, based on
<purchabr>AGL</purchabr>'s closing price of 8.50 dlrs on Friday. <acqabr>TMOC</acqabr> shares jumped
to 4.60 dlrs on the announcement from its Friday closing price
of 4.15.
    The <purchabr>AGL</purchabr> offer, the third to be made for <acqabr>TMOC</acqabr> this year,
compares with the Santos cash offer of 4.00 dlrs a share.
    Based on <acqabr>TMOC</acqabr>'s issued capital of 62.08 mln shares, the <purchabr>AGL</purchabr>
offer values the entire company at 249.9 mln shares.
    <purchabr>AGL</purchabr> said in a statement that it already holds 10.5 pct of
<acqabr>TMOC</acqabr>'s issued capital. This compares with the Santos stake of
3.1 pct when it announced its bid in March 23.
    {Elders Resources Ltd} began the auction for <acqabr>TMOC</acqabr> about
three months ago with an unsuccessful 2.55 dlrs a share
on-market offer that has since lapsed.
    <purchabr>AGL</purchabr> said its offer is above the upper end of the range of
values placed on <acqabr>TMOC</acqabr> by its advisers in the company's response
urging rejection of the Elders Resources bid.
    <purchabr>AGL</purchabr> said it will make the same offer for <acqabr>TMOC</acqabr>'s convertible
notes. Accepting share and note holders will participate in
AGL's planned one-for-one bonus issue.
    It said <acqabr>TMOC</acqabr> is already a partner with <purchabr>AGL</purchabr> in the Alice
Springs to Darwin gas pipeline and has a number of businesses
complementary with those of <purchabr>AGL</purchabr>.
    <purchabr>AGL</purchabr> is the New South Wales natural gas utility while <acqabr>TMOC</acqabr>
has extensive onshore holdings, mainly in Queensland where it
owns the Moonie oil field and in the Northern Territory where
it operates and holds 43.75 of the Mereenie <acqbus>oil-gas</acqbus> field. It
also has interests in a number of <acqbus>gas or oil</acqbus> pipelines.
