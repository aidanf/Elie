<sellerabr>UNION PACIFIC</sellerabr> {<sellercode>UNP</sellercode>} TO SELL PART OF REFINERY
    NEW YORK, March 12 - <seller>Union Pacific Corp</seller> said it <status>will sign a
pact</status> in Caracas on March 17 with <purchaser>Petroleos De Venezuela</purchaser>, <purchabr>PDVSA</purchabr>,
to sell the state owned company half of its <acquired>Corpus Christi,
Texas refinery</acquired> owned by its Union Pacific's Champlin Petroleum
Co subsidiary.
    The sale will also include the related marketing and
distribution system for the refinery's products.
    A spokesman for the company said that a statement may be
issued later today giving details of the transaction.
    There was no immediate comment from <purchabr>PDVSA</purchabr> officials in New
York.
    The <acqabr>Corpus Christi refinery</acqabr> has a capacity of about 160,000
barrels per day, the <sellerabr>Union Pacific</sellerabr> spokesman said, and is a
largely upgraded facility but he would place no value on the
transaction.
    The additional acquisition of refinery and distribution
assets by <purchabr>PDVSA</purchabr> has been expected as Venezuela has been moving
aggressively to enhance its role in the <acqbus>oil</acqbus> industry from
producer to excpanding its presence in the downstream sector.
    Purchase of part of Champlin's operations also fits a
profile which <purchabr>PDVSA</purchabr> officials have said previously they looked
for in any acquisition.
    One <purchabr>PDVSA</purchabr> official said the company was looking for
independent <acqbus>oil</acqbus> companies with good refinery and distribution
network and a strong regional presence.
    The potential purchase of the interest in Champlin followed
its earlier acquisition of a part interest in Southland Corp's
{SLC} Citgo Petroleum Corp subsidiary.
    In that agreement signed September 15, 1986, <purchabr>PDVSA</purchabr> paid
Southland 290 mln dlrs for half of Citgo's stock.
    The potetnital acquisition of half Champlin's Corpus
Christi plant will also give Venezuela an additional outlet for
its crude oil production while giving the refiner an assured
source of supply, trade sources said.
    In the earlier deal with Southland, <purchabr>PDVSA</purchabr> agredd to to
supply Citgo with at least 130,000 bpd of crude oil and other
feedstocks.
