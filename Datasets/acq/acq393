discussions have already been held with Burns Fry Ltd.

examining "three or four alternatives."
    Discussions between brokers about possible mergers is to be

the industry source said.

expected to be in place by June 30, banks, trust companies and
foreign companies will be allowed to acquire existing
investment dealers or establish their own securities
subsidiaries.
