<purchabr>SANTA FE SOUTHERN</purchabr> {<purchcode>SFX</purchcode>} APPEALS MERGER RULING
    CHICAGO, March 6 - <purchaser>Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp</purchaser> said it
filed a petition asking the U.S. Interstate Commerce Commission
to reconsider its earlier <status>rejection</status> of the merger of the
holding company's <acquired>railroad assets</acquired>.
    The ICC had rejected in July the merger of the <sellerabr>Santa Fe</sellerabr> and
<purchaser>Southern Pacific Railroads</purchaser> on the grounds that it would reduce
competition.
    <sellerabr>Santa Fe</sellerabr> in its petition outlines an array of
pro-competitive agreements with other railroads which would
preserve the economic benefits of the merger for the merged
<acqbus>railroad</acqbus> and the public.
    If the commission agrees that public benefits and
competitive enhancements will result, it can vote to reopen the
merger case. Interested parties have until March 25 to file
statements in response to the supplemental petition.
