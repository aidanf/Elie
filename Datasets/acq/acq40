<purchabr>CSR</purchabr> BIDS 2.20 DLRS A SHARE FOR <acqabr>PIONEER SUGAR MILLS</acqabr>
    SYDNEY, March 31 - <purchaser>CSR Ltd</purchaser> {<purchcode>CSRA.S</purchcode>} said it will <status>offer</status> 2.20
dlrs cash each for the shares it does not already hold in
{<acquired>Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd</acquired>}.
    <purchabr>CSR</purchabr> already holds 31.74 pct of <acqabr>Pioneer</acqabr>'s 99.80 mln issued
shares, it said in a statement.
    The offer price values the entire <acqabr>Pioneer Sugar</acqabr> share
capital at 219.6 mln dlrs and compares with today's closing
market level of 1.85 dlrs a share.
    <purchabr>CSR</purchabr> said it will announce further details of the offer
soon, including an alternative offer of <purchabr>CSR</purchabr> shares for <acqabr>Pioneer
Sugar</acqabr> stock.
    It said the offer is generous since it will give <acqabr>Pioneer
Sugar</acqabr> shareholders a price equivalent to 29 times <acqabr>Pioneer</acqabr>'s net
earnings last financial year and a premium of 22 pct over
yesterday's market price which <purchabr>CSR</purchabr> said it believed already
contained an element of takeover speculation.
    It also gives a premium of 91 pct over <acqabr>Pioneer</acqabr>'s last
reported net tangible assets per share, <purchabr>CSR</purchabr> said.
    <purchabr>CSR</purchabr> said the generous offer price reflects the cost savings
which will flow from integrated management of <purchabr>CSR</purchabr>'s and
<acqabr>Pioneer</acqabr>'s <acqbus>raw sugar mills and building materials</acqbus> businesses.
    These economies can only be achieved through <purchabr>CSR</purchabr> control
and management of <acqabr>Pioneer Sugar</acqabr>, it added.
    The takeover announcement came soon after <purchabr>CSR</purchabr>'s earlier
reported statement that it will sell its {Delhi Petroleum Pty
Ltd} unit to an Exxon Corp {XON} unit for 985 mln dlrs and not
proceed with the previously announced float of part of Delhi.
