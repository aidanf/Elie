<sellerabr>CPC</sellerabr> {<sellercode>CPC</sellercode>} TO SELL EUROPEAN BUSINESS
    NEW YORK, March 24 - <seller>CPC International Inc</seller> said it reached
an <status>agreement in principle</status> to sell its <acquired>European corn wet milling
business</acquired> to <purchaser>Agricola Finanziaria SpA</purchaser>, a member of the Ferruzzi
Group, for a price in excess of <dlramt>600 mln dlrs</dlramt>.
    The transaction is expected to be completed by September
30.
    <sellerabr>CPC</sellerabr> said it expects no material gain or loss this year from
the transaction. But the effect of the deal on 1987 earnings
can be evaluated in full only when the definitive pacts are
completed, it said.
    The long-term effect of the transaction on <sellerabr>CPC</sellerabr>'s earnings
should be positive, it added, as it will allow capital
expenditures to be cut back and will reduce corporate and
divisional overheads as well as operating expenses in the
European business.
    The sale is an important part of a restructuring announced
in November, <sellerabr>CPC</sellerabr> said.
    Proceeds of the sale will be used to reduce debt incurred
in the purchase of the Arnold Foods and Old London specialty
baking businesses and the stock repurchase program that was 
part of the restructuring.
    As of December 31, <sellerabr>CPC</sellerabr> had bought about 15 mln of its
common shares, adjusted for a 2-for-1 split in January, for a
total cost of 621.8 mln dlrs, according to its 1986 annual
report.
    In December, <sellerabr>CPC</sellerabr> acquired Arnold Foods and Old London for a
total of about 170 mln dlrs.
    <sellerabr>CPC</sellerabr> had previously said it wanted to sell the European corn
wet milling business and use the proceeds to help reduce debt,
including that incurred under the share buyback.
    In total, <sellerabr>CPC</sellerabr> has bought back about 16 mln shares of common
stock, adjusted for the split, it said today. In November it
authorized a buyback of 20 mln shares, adjusted for the split.
    The buyback and the restructuring were triggered in
November, after companies controlled by Ronald Perelman,
chairman of Revlon Group Inc {REV}, acquired about 7.6 pct of
CPC's then outstanding stock.
    In 1986, the <acquired>European corn wet milling business</acquired> had sales
of 914.1 mln dlrs, operating income before overheads of 68.8
mln dlrs and associated headquarters overhead costs of 19.7 mln
dlrs, according to <sellerabr>CPC</sellerabr>'s 1986 annual report.
    The businesses' assets were 645.7 mln dlrs in 1986, the
report said.
