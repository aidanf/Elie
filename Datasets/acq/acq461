    The group includes senior management of <acqabr>Service America</acqabr> but
no officers of <sellerabr>Allegheny Beverage</sellerabr>, the company said.
    The company has agreed to permit the group and its
potential lenders to perform a due diligence review of <acqabr>Service

there is no assurance that an acquisition proposal will be made

    <acqabr>Service America</acqabr> had fiscal 1986 revenues of about 934 mln
dlrs, or about 83 pct of <sellerabr>Allegheny Beverage</sellerabr>'s total revenues of

the acquisition group.
    On Feb 18, 1987, <sellerabr>Allegheny</sellerabr> said it was cancelling the spin
off of <acqabr>Service America</acqabr>, but gave no reason for doing so. It
said it would place major emphasis on managing Service America
to improve operations and increase earnings at the unit.
    <acqabr>Service America</acqabr>, which <sellerabr>Allegheny</sellerabr> acquired in May 1985,
operates cafeterias and food and beverage vending machines.
