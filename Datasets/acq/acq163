OFFER FOR <acqabr>DOME</acqabr> MAY SHORT-CIRCUIT ITS DEBT TALKS
    By Larry Welsh, Reuters
    NEW YORK, April 13 - A <dlramt>3.22 billion dlr</dlramt> <status>offer</status> for <acquired>Dome
Petroleum Ltd</acquired> {<acqcode>DMP.MO</acqcode>} by <purchaser>TransCanada Pipelines Ltd</purchaser> {<purchcode>TRP.TO</purchcode>}
may short-circuit <acqabr>Dome</acqabr>'s restructuring plan and open the door
for more takeover bids, oil analysts said.
    <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debt
of more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1, 1987, when an interim
debt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defer
substantial payments to creditors will expire.
    Analysts said <purchabr>TransCanada</purchabr>'s bid signals <acqabr>Dome</acqabr>'s debtholders
that an alternative exists to <acqabr>Dome</acqabr>'s debt plan.
    <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well as
public noteholders in March after several months of delicate
negotiations.
    <purchabr>TransCanada</purchabr>'s proposal "amounts to a quasi debt
restructuring," oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin Nisker
Ltd said from Toronto.
    <acqloc>Calgary</acqloc>-based <acqabr>Dome</acqabr>'s restructuring plan would allow
creditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yet
to be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked to
cash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt.
    "The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is that
even with approval of creditors, there is no assurance that
<acqabr>Dome</acqabr> will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,"
said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd in
Calgary.
    <purchabr>TransCanada</purchabr>'s announcement came as a surprise since <acqabr>Dome</acqabr>
was waiting for responses from creditors on its proposed
refinancing packages, Gobert said.
    The <purchabr>TransCanada</purchabr> proposal could open the bidding for <acqabr>Dome</acqabr>
since other potential buyers were probably waiting for lenders
to agree to a restructuring, he added.
    "I would think that the debtholders would want to entertain
any and all offers (for <acqabr>Dome</acqabr>)," Gobert said.
    <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> spokesman David Annesley said in New York that
<purchabr>TransCanada</purchabr>'s announcement could be seen as an attempt to fix
the bidding price for <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> and an effort to preclude other
possible buyers from making an offer. "By drawing attention to
us in our discussions, it means that others may be a little
reluctant to come forward," he said.
    <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> does not consider <purchabr>TransCanada</purchabr>'s proposal a formal
offer because the pipeline utility's announcement breached a
confidential agreement between the two companies, he said.
    <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> responded to the statement by suspending discussions
with <purchabr>TransCanada</purchabr> in order to pursue talks with other
unidentified parties. However, <acqabr>Dome</acqabr> said its management and
financial advisers would evaluate all proposals, including
<purchabr>TransCanada</purchabr>'s.
    Gowland said <purchabr>TransCanada</purchabr>'s offer is probably a fair price
for the company's 36.1 mln acres of <acqbus>oil and gas</acqbus> land holdings.
    However, he said not enough financial details are known
about <acqabr>Dome</acqabr>'s debt restructuring to compare the value of
<purchabr>TransCanada</purchabr>'s proposed offer.
