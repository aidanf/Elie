<purchabr>TWA</purchabr> {<purchcode>TWA</purchcode>} SUES <acqabr>USAIR</acqabr> {<acqcode>U</acqcode>} OVER POISON PILL
    NEW YORK, March 5 - <purchaser>Trans World Airlines Inc</purchaser> said it <status>filed
suit</status> in Delaware Chancery Court against <acquired>USAir Group Inc</acquired> and its
board of directors seeking to invalidate its "poison pill"
anti-takeover plan.
    <purchabr>TWA</purchabr> vice president and general counsel Mark Buckstein said
<purchabr>TWA</purchabr> also sought a declaratory judgement from the court that its
52 dlr per share takeover offer for <acqabr>USAir</acqabr> would in no way
interfer with <acqabr>USAir</acqabr>'s possible buyout of Peidmont Aviation Inc
{PIE}.
    Buckstein said <purchabr>TWA</purchabr> asked the court to enjoin the
enforcement of <acqabr>USAir</acqabr>'s shareholder rights plan, or "poison
pill." Such provisions, which typically allow for the issue of
securities to shareholders in the event of a hostile takeover
bid, are aimed at deterring takeovers by making them more
expensive.
    <acqabr>USAir</acqabr> earlier today rejected <purchabr>TWA</purchabr>'s offer, saying <purchabr>TWA</purchabr>'s bid
was an attempt to interfer with its buyout of Piedmont.
    <acqabr>USAir</acqabr> also had said its counsel would investigate the
matter. Tonight, a spokesman for <acqabr>USAir</acqabr> said the <acqbus>airline</acqbus> had no
comment on <purchabr>TWA</purchabr>'s lawsuit.
    <acqabr>USAir</acqabr> did respond, however, to a <purchabr>TWA</purchabr> request to the
Department of Transportation for permission to buy up to 51 pct
of <acqabr>USAir</acqabr> stock and place the stock in a voting trust pending
approval of a takeover.
    <acqabr>USAir</acqabr> said the request was "hastily pasted together in
order to take advantage of a regulatory anamoly that would
allow <purchabr>TWA</purchabr> to accomplish in a regulated environment actions that
would be impermissable in the non-regulated economy at large."
    <acqabr>USAir</acqabr> called on the transportation department to reject
<purchabr>TWA</purchabr>'s request.
