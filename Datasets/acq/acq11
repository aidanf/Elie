<sellerabr>HONEYWELL</sellerabr> {<sellercode>HON</sellercode>} COMPLETES COMPUTER BUSINESS SALE
    MINNEAPOLIS, Minn., March 27 - <seller>Honeywell Inc</seller> said it has
<status>completed</status> the sale of 57.5 pct of its <acquired>Honeywell Information
Systems</acquired> {<acqcode>HIS</acqcode>} <acqbus>computer</acqbus> business to {<purchaser>Compagnie des Machines
Bull</purchaser>} of France and {<purchaser>NEC Corp</purchaser>} of Japan for <dlramt>527 mln dlrs</dlramt> in
cash.
    <sellerabr>Honeywell</sellerabr> said it will use much of the money to reduce
short-term debt incurred last December when the company
purchased the Sperry Aerospace Group.
    <sellerabr>Honeywell</sellerabr> said the sale of <acqabr>HIS</acqabr> has created a new dedicated
computer company jointly owned by <purchabr>Bull</purchabr>, <purchabr>NEC</purchabr> and <sellerabr>Honeywell</sellerabr>.
    The new privately held company, named Honeywell Bull, is
42.5 pct owned by <seller>Honeywell Inc</seller>, 42.5 pct by <purchabr>Bull</purchabr> and 15 pct by
<purchabr>NEC</purchabr>, the new company said.
    <sellerabr>Honeywell</sellerabr> added that terms of the agreement with <purchabr>NEC</purchabr> and
<purchabr>Bull</purchabr> allow it to reduce its current 42.5 pct stake in the new
company to 19.9 pct at the end of 1988 by selling just over
half its shares to <purchabr>Bull</purchabr>. Book value at the time will determine
the move's pricing, <sellerabr>Honeywell</sellerabr> said.
    <sellerabr>Honeywell</sellerabr> chairman and chief executive officer, Edson
Spencer, said the move is the last major step in Honeywell's
restructuring.
    "As the leading worldwide supplier of of automation and
controls for buildings, industry, aerospace and defense,
Honeywell is now focusing its management, technical and
financial resources on high market share business," Spencer
said.
    <sellerabr>Honeywell</sellerabr> said it expects to be Honeywell Bull's largest
customer, purchasing computers for its own internal data
processing, for integration into <sellerabr>Honeywell</sellerabr> buidling and
industrial automation systems and for resale to the U.S.
governement.
    <sellerabr>Honeywell</sellerabr> said <acqabr>HIS</acqabr>'s Federal Systems Division is now a
wholly owned unit of <seller>Honeywell Inc</seller>, and has been named
Honeywell Federal Systems Inc.
    <sellerabr>Honeywell</sellerabr> said it accounted for <acqabr>HIS</acqabr> as a discontinued
operation in 1986, and will account for its future interest on
a cost basis, recording any dividends as received.
    Honeywell Bull said it will continue to develop its product
line and build its business in integrated systems for
networking, database management and transaction processing.
    The new company said its board will have nine members,
including the chairman and chief executive officer.
    Bull will have four members, <sellerabr>Honeywell</sellerabr> two and <purchabr>NEC</purchabr> one, the
new company, which began worldwide operations today, said.
    It added that Jacques Stern, <purchabr>Bull</purchabr>'s chairman and chief
executive officer, will serve as Honeywell Bull's chairman of
the board, while Jerome Meyer, formerly executive vice
president of <acquired>Honeywell Information Systems</acquired>, was named president
and chief executive officer.
