ANALYSTS SEE NO OTHER BIDDER FOR <acqabr>PUROLATOR</acqabr>{<acqcode>PCC</acqcode>}
    New York, March 2 - Several analysts said they do not
believe another suitor will top the <dlramt>265 mln dlr</dlramt> bid for
<acquired>Purolator Courier Corp</acquired> by <purchaser>E.F. Hutton LBO Inc</purchaser> and a management
group from <acqabr>Purolator</acqabr>'s courier division.
    There had been speculation another offer might be
forthcoming, but analysts mostly believe the 35 dlrs per share
price being paid by <purchabr>Hutton</purchabr> and the managers' PC Acquisition Inc
is fully valued.
    Analysts and some Wall Street sources said they doubted
another bidder would emerge since <acqabr>Purolator</acqabr> had been for sale
for sometime before a deal was struck with <purchabr>Hutton</purchabr> Friday.
    <acqabr>Purolator</acqabr>'s stock slipped 3/8 today to close at 34-3/4. It
had been trading slightly higher than the 35 dlr offer on
Friday. At least one analyst Friday speculated the company
might fetch 38 to 42 dlrs per share.
    analysts and wall street sources doubted a competitive
offer would emerge since the company has been for sale for
sometime before the deal with <purchabr>Hutton</purchabr> was struck Friday.
    <purchabr>Hutton</purchabr> had been in talks with <acqabr>Purolator</acqabr>'s adviser, Dillon,
Read and Co since late December, a <purchabr>Hutton</purchabr> spokesman said.
    <purchabr>Hutton</purchabr> is offering 35 dlrs cash per share for 83 pct of the
shares. If all shares are tendered, shareholders would receive
29 dlrs cash, six dlrs in debentures, and warrants for stock in
a subsidiary of PC Acquisition containing the <acqabr>Purolator</acqabr> U.S.
courier operation. <purchabr>Hutton</purchabr> values the warrants at two to three
dlrs per share.
    Wall Street sources also said today that a rival bidder
might be discouraged by a breakup fee Purolator would have to
pay if it ends its agreement with <purchabr>Hutton</purchabr>. The sources would not
reveal the amount of the fee, which will be noted in documents
on the transaction to be made public later this week.
