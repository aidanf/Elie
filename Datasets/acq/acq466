<acqabr>VEBA</acqabr> SHARE PLACEMENT STILL EXPECTED THIS MONTH
    BONN, March 18 - The sale of the government's 25.55 pct
stake in <acquired>VEBA AG</acquired> {<acqcode>VEBG.F</acqcode>} is <status>still expected</status> this month, banking
sources closely linked with the transaction said.
    A spokesman for the <seller>Finance Ministry</seller> said no exact date had
yet been set for the privatisation, which the government has
tabled for the second half of March. However, he added a
scandal at Volkswagen AG {VOWG.F}, VW, over currency losses "has
nothing to do" with the timing of the <acqabr>VEBA</acqabr> sale.
    Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg has said the sale of
the Federal government's stake in VW, originally scheduled for
later this year, may be delayed because of the currency affair.
    A banker involved in the <acqabr>VEBA</acqabr> placement said "Nothing has
changed in the planning. I still presume that it will take
place in the second half of March."
    This banker said there would be no reason to postpone the
issue of the 10 mln <acqabr>VEBA</acqabr> shares for a few days. He added that
the consortium which is arranging the deal had completed its
preparatory work, although the price had not been decided.
    The <acqabr>VEBA</acqabr> share has been weaker ahead of the placement but
<acqloc>West German</acqloc> stocks have been generally bearish and news of the
VW scandal last week put further pressure on the market.
