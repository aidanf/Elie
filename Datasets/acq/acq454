    Robert Stevenson, <sellerabr>K Mart</sellerabr> vice president, told Reuters the
talks, which began about six weeks ago, ended. He declined to

The name was changed to <sellerabr>K Mart</sellerabr> in 1977, Stevenson said.
    "We're selling and buying real estate in our real estate
division, and Woolworth was interested in some of our
properties. The talks were of a casual nature," he said.
    The 65 <acqabr>Kresge</acqabr> stores that are scattered around the country
in downtown and suburban locations, he said.
    Stevenson said <sellerabr>K Mart</sellerabr> will continue to operate the stores.
"The stores are profitable. The only decision <sellerabr>K Mart</sellerabr> has made
is that we will continue to operate them," he said
    <acqabr>Kresge</acqabr> had been a nationwide chain of 900 variety stores.
