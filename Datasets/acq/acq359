WALL STREET STOCKS/<purchabr>CHRYSLER</purchabr> {<purchcode>C</purchcode>}, <acqabr>AMC</acqabr> {<acqcode>AMO</acqcode>}
    DETROIT, March 9 - The proposed <dlramt>757 mln dlr</dlramt> deal under
which <purchaser>Chrysler Corp</purchaser> would acquire <acquired>American Motors Corp</acquired> was
described by analysts as a reasonable deal for both companies.
    Ronald Glantz of Montgomery Securities said <acqabr>AMC</acqabr> common
stock could be fairly valued at "just under five dlrs a share"
given changes brought by tax reform and that <purchabr>Chrysler</purchabr>'s offer
to pay four dlrs a share of <purchabr>Chrysler</purchabr> stock to <acqabr>AMC</acqabr> holders other
than Renault as a "a good price for <purchabr>Chrysler</purchabr>.
    <acqabr>AMC</acqabr> common shares opened at four dlrs this morning after
the Renault-Chrysler announcement, up 3/8, while <purchabr>Chrysler</purchabr>
shares lost 1/4 to 52-1/4.
    Though <acqabr>AMC</acqabr> issued a statement saying that it was studying
the proposed buyout and had no other comment, Glantz said he
regarded the proposal as a "done deal" because "I can't believe
anybody else would make a bid."
    "It's a reasonable deal for both sides," the analyst told
Reuters.
    "<purchabr>Chrysler</purchabr> gets the jeep franchise and the (new <acqabr>AMC</acqabr>)
Bramalea, Ontario, plant and the (new Renault) Premier
(mid-sized car) and <acqabr>AMC</acqabr>'s sales will go up because buyers will
have more confidence that the manufacturer will still be around
to service the products," Glantz said.
    Analyst Thomas O'Grady said <purchabr>Chrysler</purchabr> would be getting more
manufacturing capacity, including a brand-new plant in Canada,
for a bargain price and Renault would be getting some return
after its prolonged loss-making investment in <acqabr>AMC</acqabr>.
