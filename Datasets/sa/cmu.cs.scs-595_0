<paragraph><sentence>The anticipation of performing large-scale simulations to address crucial
questions in the area of biomolecule structure and dynamics (for example
protein folding, drug discovery, enzyme catalysis) is fueled by advances in
the development of massively parallel hardware</sentence>.  <sentence>However, realization of
this goal requires not only the hardware developments, but also a
substantial investment in the development and implementation of scalable
algorithms to carry out simulations of biomolecules</sentence>.  <sentence>In this seminar, I
will discuss some of the "grand challenge" problems which motivate work on
the software side, with a particular focus to problems being addressed in
our research group</sentence>.  <sentence>I will then describe efforts underway in our laboratory
to address the algorithmic/software questions for biomolecule dynamics</sentence>.
<sentence>Emphasis will be laid upon the description of two strategies we have
experimented with for molecular dynamics on parallel architecture machine</sentence>.
<sentence>First, I will describe the implementation of a molecular dynamics kernel for
studies of solutions of small molecules on the CM-2, Cray and CM-5</sentence>.  <sentence>Next, I
will describe preliminary work on utilizing a tightly coupled heterogeneous
computing environment (the Cray YMP and CM-2 connected via a HiPPI) to carry
out calculations on solvated protein and peptide molecules</sentence>.  <sentence>I will
summarize with a discussion of the future prospects for using MPP
architectures with peak computational rates in the teraflop range for
biomolecule dynamics</sentence>.</paragraph>
