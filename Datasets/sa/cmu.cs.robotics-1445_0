 Title: <sentence>Learning to Understand Information on the Internet</sentence>.

<paragraph><sentence>The explosive growth in the number and diversity of information
sources on the Internet is rapidly outstripping our ability to find
what we want</sentence>.  <sentence>Browsers and Indexing tools are practical, but only
partial, solutions to this problem</sentence>.  <sentence>A number of information gathering
agents have emerged</sentence>.  <sentence>However, because such agents require a
programmer to hand code a model of each information source in their
repertoire, they too are victims of information explosion</sentence>.  <sentence>This talk
explores automatically learning models of information sources as a
possible solution</sentence>.</paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>I will describe ILA, a domain-independent program that learns the
meaning of external information by explaining it in terms of internal
categories</sentence>.  <sentence>In one experiment, ILA starts off with knowledge of local
faculty members, quickly learns a model of the Internet service WHOIS,
and then bootstraps to learn models of the personnel directories
available at Berkeley, Brown, Cal-Tech, Cornell, Rice, Rutgers, and
UCI</sentence>.  <sentence>ILA's hypothesis language is first-order conjunctions, and its
bias is compactly encoded as a determination</sentence>.  <sentence>I introduce a
probabilistic model of ILA that bounds its sample complexity, and show
when this bound is tighter than the famous Haussler bound</sentence>.</paragraph>

<sentence>This talk is based on joint work with Mike Perkowitz</sentence>

<paragraph><sentence><speaker>Professor Etzioni</speaker> will be at CMU March 6, 7 and 8th</sentence>.  <sentence>If you would like an
appointment with him on Monday, March 6, please send mail to plp@cs, or call
x8-7897 (Phyllis)</sentence>.</paragraph>
