Abstract: 


 Speaker: <speaker>Professor Reuven Karni</speaker>, Technion Institute of Technology
 Topic:	Exploring the autonomous learning problem with mathematical programming
 When: Tuesday February 12, 1991, <stime>1:30</stime>-<etime>2:30pm</etime>,  <location>Doherty Hall 3313</location>
<paragraph><sentence>The autonomous learning problem (ALP) is defined as: A series of training
examples is provided, characterized by a conjunction of specific values of a
set of common attributes, and a class to which it belongs</sentence>.  <sentence>The goal is to
construct an effective classifier for categorizing these examples</sentence>.  <sentence>The ALP
is formulated as a set-covering problem, a set-partitioning problem, and as
a general 0-1 problem</sentence>.  <sentence>This enables an extnesive investigation to be
carried out as to the relationships between rules and examples; "data" and
"knowledge"; and attitudes regarding the "best" set of rules forming a rule
base"</sentence>.</paragraph>
