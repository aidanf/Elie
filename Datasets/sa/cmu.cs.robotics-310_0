<paragraph><sentence>Reconfigurable learning machines are embodiments of the Evolving Transformation
Systems (ETS), a new mathematical model proposed resently by the speaker</sentence>. <sentence>The
development of the ETS was motivated by the unification of the two basic
analytical paradigms, continuous and discrete: one, in which the objects are
represented as elements of a finite-dimensional vector space, and the other,
in which the objects are represented as strings, trees,etc</sentence>. <sentence>Within the first
paradigm, very efficient learning algorithms have been developed, mainly due
to the presence of the classical continuous structure (on the vector space)</sentence>.
<sentence>The second paradigm offers in some sense a more satisfactory object description
that can be linked more naturally to various propositional object (class)
descriptions</sentence>.  <sentence>Neural nets and other classical pattern recognition systems
belong to the first paradigm, while examples of the systems that belong to the
second paradigm are syntactic (based on the generative grammars) learning
systems as well as the version space based systems</sentence>.</paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>ETS represents a fundamentally new learning model, in which in the classical
production system (transformation system, TS) a very natural competing family
of distance functions is introduced: a nonnegative weight is assigned to each
production and the distance between two objects is defined as the length of
the shortest weighted sequence of productions necessary to transform one object
into the other</sentence>. <sentence>During learning, which is an optimization process, one or
several of these distances (i.e. the corresponding weight vectors) inducing
appropriate metric structures in the set of all objects is selected</sentence>. <sentence>However,
the critical feature of the ETS is the possibility of efficient modification
of the current set of productions in the TS during learning, thus generating
an evolving sequence of TS, each providing more accurate means for both the
learning class recognition and description</sentence>.</paragraph>
