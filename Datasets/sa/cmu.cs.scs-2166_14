University Teaching Center
Seminars Series for Graduate Students
"Managing Current Courses, Anticipating Future Roles"

ABOUT THE SERIES

<paragraph>"<sentence>Managing Current Courses, Anticipating Future Roles" is a weekly series of
interactive seminars designed for graduate students</sentence>.  <sentence>On a pilot basis for
1993-94, the Teaching Center will offer several  in-depth, three-week
modules and several one-session special topics on different aspects of
college teaching and learning</sentence>.  </paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>The modules provide an opportunity for sustained discussion of selected
topics because we ask you to make a commitment to attend 3 or 4 related
sessions</sentence>.  <sentence>This format allows you to try some different strategies and then
discuss how they worked with other participants</sentence>.  <sentence>Also, for some modules we
may ask you to bring some sample materials from your discipline so that the
applications can be most useful to you</sentence>.  <sentence>The special topic format allows you
to sample a combination of topics based on your interest in different types
of students, course formats, or teaching styles</sentence>.  </paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>To facilitate discussion each session will have no more than 20
participants</sentence>.  <sentence>Some of the sessions may break into smaller groups to
accommodate the interests of people in different disciplines</sentence>.  <sentence>Experienced
TAs, faculty, and administrators will be present to facilitate discussion at
several sessions</sentence>.</paragraph>  

<paragraph><sentence>You should pre-register for sessions of interest to you by using the form
included in this program description, or by contacting Michelle
Gregg-Rassau, at x2896 or mg2e@andrew.cmu.edu</sentence>.  <sentence>Please note that the
locations for Spring 1994 seminars will be announced at a later date</sentence>.  <sentence>If
you have questions about these seminars,  please contact Rea Freeland,
Associate Director, at x7981 or rf51@andrew.cmu.edu</sentence>.   </paragraph>
