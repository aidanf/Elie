 TITLE:	Learning Control for Improved Performance in 
 	Repetitive Robot Operations

<paragraph><sentence>Learning control refers to control systems that can learn from previous 
experience performing a specific task, in order to improve their performance 
in future executions of the task</sentence>. <sentence>Although there are some precursors, the filed 
started in 1984 with several researchers on different continents (including 
<speaker>Professor Longman</speaker>, then Australia) addressing the problem of improving control 
system performance for robots performing repetitive tasks on assembly lines</sentence>. 
<sentence>The talk will give an overview of learning control strategies that make use of 
control theory concepts to accomplish their learning</sentence>.</paragraph>
