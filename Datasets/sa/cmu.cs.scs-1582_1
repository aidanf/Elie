Abstract: 

<paragraph><sentence>This talk is the next in a series of live, interactive video conferences
that will be held every Wednesday <stime>7 pm</stime> - <etime>8:30 pm</etime> between January 20 and
May 5 1993</sentence>.  <sentence>These conferences are being organized by a few west coast
schools, hence the name, the West Coast Colloquium</sentence>.  <sentence>This will be something
of a multiple university distinguished speakers series</sentence>.  <sentence>The participants,
so far, are Berkeley, Stanford, Washington, UCLA, UC San Diego, UC Santa
Barbara, and us</sentence>.</paragraph>
<paragraph><sentence>The technology is Picturetel based with conference bridging by AT&T</sentence>.  <sentence>There
will be multiple monitors at each site;  cameras at every site are voice
activated to force the display to show that site, so that the distributed
audience can have camera time to ask questions</sentence>.</paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>Wednesday's seminars are still experiemental</sentence>.  <sentence>Many sites have yet to
get all the equipment working for such an ambitious conference call</sentence>.
<sentence>Even if everything is working well, there will be a noticeable lag
between your speech and its broadcast to your and others' monitors</sentence>.</paragraph><sentence>
