	Learning Control Knowledge for Scheduling

<paragraph><sentence>While the general class of most scheduling problems is NP-hard in
worst-case complexity (i.e., a general solution is doomed to poor 
performance), in practice, for specific distributions of problems
and constraints, domain-specific solutions have been shown to perform
in much better than exponential time</sentence>.  <sentence>However, discovering these
search strategies is a knowledge-intensive time-consuming process
which requires a deep understanding of the domain</sentence>.</paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>The goal of this work is to develop techniques to allow for automated
learning of effective domain-specific schedulers from a general
scheduler with a flexible control strategy</sentence>.  <sentence>In this approach,
techniques from machine learning and statistics are used to
automaticaly find control settings to for the scheduler which allow it
to improve performance on the domain-specific problems of interest</sentence>.</paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>These techniques have been applied to learning control settings for a 
scheduler to schedule operations for the 26-meter subnet of the Deep 
Space Network (DSN), operated by JPL and used to communicate with orbiting
spacecraft and satellites</sentence>.  <sentence>For DSN projected schedules, the machine learning
techniques were able to decrease the amount of CPU time required to
produce a schedule by 50% for problems solvable by the scheduler</sentence>.
<sentence>In addition, the machine learning allowed the scheduler to solve 15% more 
of the problems within computational resource limitations</sentence>.</paragraph>

<paragraph>(<sentence>This is joint work with Jonathan Gratch and Gerald DeJong of the
University of Illinois</sentence>)</paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>Steve is interested in meeting with anyone working on projects in planning,
scheduling and learning</sentence>. <sentence>If you are interested in meeting with Steve, please
set up a time with Carol (boshears@isl1.ri.cmu.edu)</sentence>.</paragraph>
