Abstract: 


                                  SEMINAR

    The Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC) is hosting a seminar titled:

        ***Computational Materials Science:  The Dawn of a New Age***

                                presented by
                             <speaker>Arthur J.  Freeman</speaker>
                     Department of Physics and Astronomy
                           Northwestern University

<paragraph><sentence>Advances in computational electronic structure methods combined with those in
computer hardware (and software) have led to the development of a new branch
of materials science- computational materials science</sentence>.  <sentence>In the dawn of this 
new age, impressive starts have already been made to understand the complexity 
of real materials with their intriguing interplay between the underlying
chemical, physical and structural properties</sentence>.  <sentence>This talk illustrates several 
areas addressed recently, particularly at PSC</sentence>.</paragraph>

                         Date:   Friday, September 16, 1994
