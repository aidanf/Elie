The EPAM Model of Experts' Discrimination and Learning: Implications for AI
by <speaker>Herbert Simon</speaker>

<paragraph><sentence>EPAM is a program (the first version was Ed Feigenbaum's thesis) that
learns to discriminate among, hence recognize, symbol structures</sentence>.  <sentence>Its
employs a discrimination net, and a learning process that grows the
net by exposure to symbol structures and feedback of its success or
failure in classification</sentence>.</paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>EPAM was designed as a psychological theory of human perception and
memory, and has been tested (successfully) with human data in a wide
range of experimental paradigms</sentence>.  <sentence>It belongs to the small set of
"unified" theories of cognition, though like SOAR or ACT*, it covers
only a part of the waterfront</sentence>.</paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>Apart from psychology, EPAM exhibits a set of mechanisms of
considerable relevance to general theories of learning and concept
attainment, as well as memory organization</sentence>.  <sentence>For example, it was an
ancestor of the RETE nets used in production systems, and can be
viewed as a large indexed data base</sentence>.  <sentence>The talk will discuss these and
other points of relevance of EPAM to current research in AI</sentence>.</paragraph>
