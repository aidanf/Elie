<paragraph> ABSTRACT: <sentence>We will demonstrate the sytem "automata" that implements
 finite state machines</sentence>.  <sentence>The system consists of a Mathematica package
 together with a special purpose calculator that communicate via
 MathLink</sentence>.  <sentence>Most of the standard operations on finite state machines
 are implemented, including the computation of syntactic semigroups and
 their decomposition into D-classes</sentence>.  <sentence>Documentation for the system is
 available in the form of Mathematica notebooks as well as in printed
 form</sentence>.  <sentence>The "automata" package has been used as a teaching tool in a
 standard graduate course on automata theory</sentence>.  <sentence>The finite state machine
 calculator can also operate independently of Mathematica, and is
 helpful in the study of linear cellular automata</sentence>.</paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>Recent versions of Mathematica are equipped with MathLink, a high-
level communications protocol that allows one to connect external
programs to a Mathematica kernel</sentence>.  <sentence>Probably the most useful aspect of
MathLink is the fact that it enables one to use Mathematica as a
frontend to a special purpose program</sentence>.  <sentence>Mathematica can then be
employed to display, manipulate and document the data generated by the
external program</sentence>.</paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>After the lecture, <speaker>Prof. Sutner</speaker> will be glad to demonstrate and
discuss the use of MathLink and his "automata" package</sentence>. </paragraph>
