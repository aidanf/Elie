 TITLE:	  3D-TV (and Workstations)

<paragraph><sentence>High definition, high speed displays integrated with fast digitization,
image storage, and image processing now permit us to implement several
concepts for 3D-sterescopic television (and computer workstations), many
of which have been around, unimplementable, for a long time</sentence>.  <sentence>In this
talk I will</sentence>:</paragraph>

  -- review the fundamentals of binocular 3D-stereoscopic vision

  -- review historical approaches to 3D-image and 3D-stream pair display

  -- narrow the discussion to approaches that use a single more-or-less flat
     screen (like a TV or workstation monitor)

  -- describe my group's research in several areas:

     ** the physics of re-creating naked-eye and augmented-eye reality

     ** the state-of-the-art in video: delivering the full spatial and
        temporal resolution of an NTSC stream per eye

     ** three increasingly sophisticated approaches to presenting video
        and/or computer graphics on a workstation

        ~~ a well known special purpose hardware based full-screen,
           half spatial resolution approach

        ~~ our adaptation of this approach to an X-Windows environment,
           still full screen

        ~~ our new "Stereo-in-Windows" approach, which allows arbitrary
           mixes of stereo and flat XWindows on one screen at one time
           at full resolution

     ** progress in the (I will show you: related) areas of image compression,
        intermediate view interpolation, and user-adjustable stereopsis

  -- demonstrate as much of this as it is practical to set up in the <location>Adamson
     Wing auditorium</location> [TBD].
