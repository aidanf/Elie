<paragraph><sentence>Future parallel computers must execute efficiently both hand-coded
applications and also programs written in high-level programming
languages</sentence>.  <sentence>Today's machines limit programs to a single communication
paradigm---message-passing or shared-memory---which results in uneven
performance</sentence>.  <sentence>To address this problem, we have developed the Tempest
interface, which supports shared-memory, message-passing, and hybrid
applications</sentence>.  <sentence>Tempest enhances portability of parallel programs by
allowing low-cost networks of workstations to provide the same
abstractions (e.g., shared memory) as high-performance parallel
machines</sentence>.</paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>The Tempest interface consists of low-level communication and
memory-system mechanisms</sentence>.  <sentence>Policies, such as shared memory, are
implemented in user-level software, which allows programmers and
compilers to customize policies to an application's semantics and
sharing patterns</sentence>.  <sentence>Experiments show that custom cache coherency
policies can produce upto an order-of-magnitude performance
improvement</sentence>.</paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>We have completed two implementations of the Tempest interface</sentence>.
<sentence>Typhoon illustrates the performance of first-class hardware support
for Tempest</sentence>.  <sentence>This proposed hardware system implements Tempest using a
fully-programmable, user-level processor in the network interface</sentence>.
<sentence>Blizzard demonstrates Tempest's portability by implementing the
interface in software running on stock hardware (a Thinking Machines
CM-5)</sentence>.  <sentence>We are currently developing a third Tempest implementation by
porting Blizzard to the Wisconsin COW (Cluster Of Workstations)</sentence>.</paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>This work is part of the Wisconsin Wind Tunnel project, co-led by
Mark Hill, James Larus, and David Wood</sentence>.</paragraph>
