 TITLE: SOLVING SCHEDULING PROBLEMS WITH THE HELP OF MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS

<paragraph><sentence>The talk presents work which was done in Research Project 331
Information Processing in Autonomous Mobile Robot Systems at
the Technische Universitaet in Munich and in Research Project
AKA-MOD on Modeling Cooperative Agents at the Deutsches Forschungszentrum</paragraph></sentence>

<paragraph><sentence>In the talk the multi-agent system MAGSY is presented firstly</sentence>.
<sentence>The kernel of an agent in MAGSY is a forward-chaining rule
interpreter</sentence>. <sentence>Therefore, each agent has the problem solving
capacity of an expert system</sentence>. <sentence>Each agent in MAGSY is a self-contained
entity with a unique identification</sentence>. <sentence>If an agent knows the identification
of another agent, it is able to send this agent messages</sentence>. <sentence>In doing so
the agents perform services and call on services of other agents</sentence>.
<sentence>Agents are able to create new agents dynamically</sentence>. <sentence>If an agent
creates a new agent, it automatically knows the identification of
this new agent</sentence>. <sentence>The knowledge of the agents is structured in an
object-oriented knowledge representation scheme</sentence>. <sentence>There is a global
knowledge base which contains the knowledge that may be accessed
by all of the agents</sentence>. <sentence>Agents may store their identification in this
global knowledge base and thus become known to all agents in the system</sentence>.</paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>In the second part of the talk two applications which have been
implemented using the MAGSY system are presented</sentence>. <sentence>The first
example here is the design of a planning and controlling hierarchy
for a flexible manufacturing system with the help of MAGSY</sentence>. <sentence>The second
example is the design of a multi-agent system for modeling the transportation
domain</sentence>. <sentence>Here a set of shipping companies each of which controls a set
of trucks has to execute client orders cooperatively</sentence>.
<sentence>In both examples a scheduling problem has to be solved</sentence>. <sentence>In the first case
a set of manufacturing orders has to be distributed to a set of
machine tools and in the second case a set of transportation orders
has to be distributed to a set of trucks</sentence>. <sentence>The talk will explain
the design of the multi-agent solutions for these two applications
and how the scheduling problem was solved in each case</sentence>.</paragraph>
