 TITLE: FILTERS FOR IMAGE RESAMPLING

<paragraph><sentence>A common problem in image processing is resampling a raster image</sentence>.
<sentence>This task crops up when removing distortions from satellite images and
when performing texture mapping in computer graphics, for example</sentence>.
<sentence>Careful filtering must be done during resampling or the results will
appear blocky or show aliasing</sentence>.  <sentence>Traditionally, most research in
resampling has addressed special cases</sentence>.  <sentence>Often, the class of mappings
is restricted to be affine (translation, rotation, and scaling), in
which case the filter is space invariant</sentence>.  <sentence>Furthermore, filters are
often designed for interpolation (upsampling) only or decimation
(downsampling) only</sentence>.</paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>In this talk, we develop a unified theory for image resampling filters,
which subsumes previous methods for affine mappings, interpolation, and
decimation</sentence>.  <sentence>The theory describes the space variant filter for
resampling a multidimensional signal according to an arbitrary mapping
without aliasing</sentence>.  <sentence>A simple, fast approximation technique employing
elliptical Gaussian filters will be demonstrated</sentence>.</paragraph>
