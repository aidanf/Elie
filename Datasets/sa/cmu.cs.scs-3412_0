 LabSpace:  Developing the National Electronic Laboratory Infrastructure

<paragraph><sentence>The LabSpace project integrates emerging multiuser virtual
environment technology with state of the art multimedia interfaces in
order to support scientific collaboration</sentence>.  <sentence>The resulting networked
environment, composed of a persistent collection of objects and a
flexible history mechanism, allows the creation of electronic virtual
laboratories</sentence>.  <sentence>These virtual laboratories will be networked locations
where scientists will interact with analytical electron microscopes,
high energy physics experiments and data, and, most importantly, each
other</sentence>.  <sentence>The LabSpace project will develop the tools to create these
virtual laboratories and the scientists' interfaces, and will
validate these integrated tools in two end-user testbeds</sentence>.</paragraph>
