<paragraph><sentence>In the coming decades, man will probably send robots to explore the solar
system</sentence>.  <sentence>In particular, we envision the need for mobile robots that can
navigate, map, and acquire samples on another planet, such as Mars</sentence>.  <sentence>To
perform these tasks in such isolated and uncertain environments, the robots
must be highly reliable and fairly autonomous</sentence>.</paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>The CMU Planetary Rover project has built the Ambler, a highly mobile and
energy efficient six-legged walking robot</sentence>.  <sentence>Integrating the component
technologies of planning, perception and real-time control, we have
developed a system that autonomously walks the Ambler over rugged terrain</sentence>.
<sentence>The talk will describe research results in real-time control of many degrees
of freedom, perception of rugged terrain using a laser range-finder, and
gait, footfall, and leg-recovery planning</sentence>.  <sentence>The components are integrated
using the distributed Task Control Architecture (TCA), which supports
concurrent planning, execution, monitoring, and error recovery</sentence>.  <sentence>The talk
will describe our integration efforts and the strategies employed for
ensuring reliable and competent performance of the Ambler</sentence>.</paragraph>
