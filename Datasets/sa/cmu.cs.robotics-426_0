<paragraph><sentence>Some of the fundamental problems associated with the use of computer vision
systems for fully automated geometric measurements will be discussed,
 including: geometric distortion characteristics of vision systems, methods
 of geometric calibration, target identification and centroiding, model
 integration, and surface modeling</sentence>.  <sentence>A vision system that has been developed
 to measure the shape, volume, and surface area of human bodies will be used
 as the focus for discussion</sentence>.</paragraph>
