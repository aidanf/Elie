<paragraph><sentence>Recently, there has been a surge of interests in the area of
high-speed networks</sentence>.  "<sentence>Information Superhighway" promises
to provide various digital services ranging from conventional
telephone to interactive high-definition TV</sentence>. 
<sentence>Regional telephone companies and cable companies plan to 
invest billions of dollars to provide an
infrastructure for high-speed networks</sentence>.</paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>Multiplexing video with data, audio, voice, and text, for example,
represents a disparity of data rates and qualities that poses
new challenges when creating a technology that is faster, less
expensive, and more flexible</sentence>.  
<sentence>Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) is the internationally standardized
transport technique for such high-speed multimedia networks</sentence>.
<sentence>ATM is a promising technique for implementing an integrated access
and transport network that can easily be shared by end-users holding
multimedia service calls</sentence>.</paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>My presentation will primarily be on the current state of the 
ATM technology, products, and market</sentence>.  <sentence>It will include a 
discussion on the emerging network architectures in Broadband/ATM 
networking and some of the early applications</sentence>.
<sentence>Additionally, the presentation will focus on some of 
the key issues related to interworking between ATM and other 
technologies and the drivers behind ATM adoption/deployment</sentence>.  </paragraph>
