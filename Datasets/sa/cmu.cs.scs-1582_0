Abstract: 

<paragraph><sentence><speaker>Prof Patterson</speaker> has demonstrated classical "absent-minded
professor" symptoms</sentence>.  <sentence>The abstract posted a few days ago
is not the talk that he plans to give</sentence>.  <sentence>Instead, he appears
to be giving the talk we saw last spring in our Distinguished
Lecture Series</sentence>.  <sentence>It was good then, so if you missed it or
would like a reprise, come tomorrow evening</sentence>. </paragraph>   ----  garth

	         West Coast Computer Science Colloquium

		      Terabytes >> Teraflops
	<sentence>Or why work on processors when I/O is where the action is</sentence>?

			<speaker>David A. Patterson</speaker>
	   Professor and Chair, Computer Science Division,
	  EECS Department, University of California, Berkeley

                        <stime>7:15</stime> - <etime>8:15 pm</etime>
                        <location>4623 Wean Hall</location>
                (via Picturetel from Berkeley)
                moderated locally by Garth Gibson
[[[[[[  <sentence>This is likely to be similar to the distinguished lecture given by
	Patterson here at CMU last spring</sentence>.    ---  garth  ]]]]]]]

<paragraph><sentence>Amdahl's Law tells us with faster processors we
need faster and larger I/O</sentence>. <sentence>Unfortunately disks are getting smaller rather
than faster</sentence>.  <sentence>This talk describes the results of the RAID project
(Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks), which offers much
greater performance, capacity, and reliablity from I/O systems</sentence>.</paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>I will also talk about a new project getting underway called Sequoia 2000,
which looks at utilizing small helical scan tapes, such as
digital-audio tapes or video tapes, to offer terabytes of
storage for the price of a fileserver</sentence>. (<sentence>Sequoia 2000 is the Digital
Equipment Corporation funded successor to MIT's Project Athena;
it promises terabytes of economical and low latency storage
for global change scientists at the University of California</sentence>.)</paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>My thesis is that a factor of 1000 increase in storage capacity available
on most Ethernets will have a much greater impact than a factor of
1000 increase in processing speed for a gaggle of scientists</sentence>.</paragraph>
