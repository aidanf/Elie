			      UBIQUITOUS COMPUTING

<paragraph><sentence>Inspired  by  the social scientists, philosophers, and anthropologists at PARC,
we have been trying to take a radical look at what computing ought to be  like</sentence>.
<sentence>Two  key  points  are:  people  live in an environmental surround, using space,
muscle memory, 3-d body surround; and that people live through their  practices
and  tacit  knowledge  so  that  the  most  powerful  things are those that are
effectively invisible in use</sentence>.  <sentence>How  can  we  make  everyday  computing  conform
better  to these principles of human effectiveness, while avoiding the traps of
virtual reality </sentence>?  <sentence>Our approach</sentence>:</paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>Activate the world</sentence>.  <sentence>Provide hundreds of wireless computing devices per  person
per  office, of all scales (from 1" displays to wall sized)</sentence>. <sentence>We are doing O.S.,
wireless  LAN,  U.I.,  packaging,  display,  pen,  handwriting,  protocol,  and
interoperability  research  to  help bring this about</sentence>.  <sentence>We call it: "ubiquitous
computing</sentence>".</paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>We are completely off the workstation, PC, and PDA track</sentence>.  <sentence>These things in  the
office,  every place you are, are not personal</sentence>.  <sentence>You just grab anything that is
nearby, and use it</sentence>.  <sentence>Your information and state follows you,  the  hundreds  of
devices in your office or meeting room adjust to support you</sentence>.</paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>We  are not all that far along, this is a ten to twenty year quest</sentence>.  <sentence>We do have
some prototype devices working</sentence>.  <sentence>In this talk  I'll  describe  the  origins  of
ubiquitous  computing,  the  research  approach, and some specific scenarios of
future computing that we  consider  important</sentence>.    <sentence>I'll  distinguish  ubiquitous
computing  from  notebook, palmtop, multimedia, personal digital assistant, GUI
and virtual reality computing</sentence>.  <sentence>And I'll describe some of the current state  of
our hardware and software</sentence>.</paragraph>
