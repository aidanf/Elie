<paragraph><sentence>Dexterity is an important feature for robots that 
operate intelligently and independently in their environment</sentence>.
<sentence>While planning dexterous manipulation can be viewed as a general 
motion planning problem, this leads to intractable algorithms</sentence>.
<sentence>Instead, we develop efficient geometric algorithms for the class
of parts orientations problems</sentence>. <sentence>For a given set of cooperating agents
(which can be robot fingers, robot arms, mobile robots, or fixtures in
the environment), an object, and a desired reorientation, we wish to
synthesize a  robust plan for the agents that accomplishes the desired
reorientation</sentence>.  <sentence>We present an efficient and exact $O(n\log n)$
algorithm for the reorientation of polygonal objects of size $n$ and
show its extension to polyhedra</sentence>. <sentence>This algorithm exploits 
the geometric structure of the problem and the task mechanics and
is near-sensorless, in that it requires only sparse sensing</sentence>.  </paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>We are currently implementing the planar reorientation problem in the
context of a team of cooperating autonomous mobile robots</sentence>.
<sentence>The team will reorient boxes with polyhedral cross sections</sentence>.
<sentence>Since the reorientation plan requires a model, we describe an
algorithm for the robust acquisition of geometric models by mobile robots
with error bounds and demonstrate its performance with a video</sentence>.
<sentence>This work (joint with Jim Jennings) is an
exploration of how, even with sparse and noisy sensors typically found
on mobile robots, we can build adequate accounts and detailed models
of manipulable objects, while satisfying the modeling and information
requests of near-sensorless manipulation planners</sentence>. </paragraph>
