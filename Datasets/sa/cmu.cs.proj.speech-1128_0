<paragraph>        <sentence>A prototype for a speech-to-text transcription 
system is described</sentence>.  <sentence>This system recognizes continuous 
phrase speech and transcribes it in Japanese text</sentence>.  <sentence>This 
paper outlines methods for acoustic and linguistic 
processing, and describes the system configuration and 
results of performance evaluation tests</sentence>.</paragraph>
<paragraph>        <sentence>First, the user inputs 120 consonant-vowel syllables
(CVs) and 600 high-frequency words allowing the system to 
make initial CV and word templates as the basis for 
recognition</sentence>.  <sentence>As one speaks texts phrase by phrase, it is 
recognized by a word-spotting method using a continuous 
dynamic programming technique</sentence>.  <sentence>High frequency words and CVs
in continuous phrase speech are detected using established 
CV and word templates</sentence>.  <sentence>They are converted to phrase 
candidates using a word dictionary, inflection table, and an
attached word dictionary</sentence>.  <sentence>If a word-chain in a candidate 
phrase is matched with a frequent word co-occurrence 
pattern, or a pair of adjacent candidate phrases are matched
with a frequent phrase co-occurrence pattern, these 
candidate phrases take precedence over all others</sentence>.  <sentence>Finally,
ten high-score phrase translation candidates remain, and the
system displays the most feasible one on the monitor</sentence>.  <sentence>After
the entire text is input orally, one corrects recognition 
results by monitoring the input text aurally</sentence>.  <sentence>If a phrase 
conversion result is incorrect, one selects the right one 
from the ten phrase candidates, or corrects the nearest one 
with the keyboard</sentence>.  <sentence>The speech data is also used to adjust 
the CV templates eliminating ineffective ones and adding 
effective CV syllables in the input speech</sentence>.</paragraph> 
<paragraph>        <sentence>A performance evaluation test was carried out for 
X-ray CT scanning reports</sentence>.  <sentence>Before the test, a word 
dictionary and co-occurrence patterns were extracted by 
analyzing 1,500 scanning reports which contained a total of 
about 70,000 phrases</sentence>.  <sentence>The current dictionary vocabulary 
size (about 2,500 words) and the number of co-occurrence 
patterns (about 2,000) were established at this time</sentence>.  
<sentence>Phrase-recognition accuracies of 65-75% and 30-50% were 
obtained for normal, and abnormal CT reports, respectively</sentence>. 
<sentence>Accuracy was lower for abnormal reports because of the 
complexity of the text</sentence>.  <sentence>Input speeds of 30-50 
characters/minute and 10-20 characters/minute were obtained 
respectively</sentence>.  <sentence>After iterative training, phrase-recognition 
accuracies were improved by about 10% and input speeds were 
improved by about 10 characters/minute</sentence>.  <sentence>These input speeds 
were a little lower than that of a professional transcriber</sentence>.
<sentence>Testing on time and fatigue benefits against keyboard inputs
at a hospital is currently being conducted</sentence>.</paragraph>
