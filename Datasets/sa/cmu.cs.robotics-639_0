<paragraph><sentence>I will describe our research in automating the kinematic analysis of
rigid part mechanisms, such as gears, cylinder locks, clutches, and
transmissions</sentence>.  <sentence>Kinematic analysis determines the constraints on the
behavior of a mechanism imposed by the shapes of its parts and by the
contacts among them</sentence>.  <sentence>Automating the analysis is an important step
toward automating the overall design and analysis of mechanisms</sentence>.  <sentence>The
computational complexity of kinematic analysis depends on the shapes
and motion types of the parts of the mechanism, and is in general
intractable</sentence>.  <sentence>We have identified engineering restrictions on part
shapes and interactions that make kinematic analysis feasible</sentence>.  <sentence>Most
mechanisms belong to the feasible class according to a survey of 2500
mechanisms in a standard mechanical engineering encyclopedia</sentence>.  <sentence>We have
developed an efficient kinematic analysis program for feasible
mechanisms</sentence>.  <sentence>The program derives the motion of the parts for given
input motions and internal forces, such as gravity and friction</sentence>.  <sentence>It
uses a simple model of dynamics that captures the steady-state effect
of forces without the conceptual and computational cost of traditional
dynamical simulation</sentence>.  <sentence>It generates a compact, symbolic behavioral
description and a realistic, three-dimensional animation</sentence>.  <sentence>It can also
generate the space of behaviors for all possible input motions</sentence>.</paragraph>
