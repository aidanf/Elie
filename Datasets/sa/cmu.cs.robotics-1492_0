Abstract: 
<sentence>Friends, 
<paragraph>the illusions of Carnival have forced us to move the RI Faculty Candidate
seminar to <location>Smith Hall 125</sentence></location>.  <sentence>See you there</sentence>.  <sentence>A million thanks to Cleah and a
number of other folks for helping out with the sudden switch</sentence>.  Best, Mike</paragraph>

                Piezoelectric Ultrasonic Micromotors

                          <speaker>Anita M. Flynn</speaker>
                           MIT AI Lab

<paragraph>    <sentence>Utilizing the large piezoelectric coefficients and high dielectric
constants of ferroelectric thin films, it is possible to
microfabricate ultrasonic motors on silicon substrates</sentence>.  <sentence>This talk
will describe our efforts in this area</sentence>.  <sentence>By using ferroelectric thin
films of lead zirconate titanate (PZT), a two-order of magnitude
improvement over bulk ceramic materials is obtained in breakdown
strength</sentence>.  <sentence>This characteristic, in combination with high dielectric
permittivities, leads to a three-order of magnitude improvement over
electrostatic micromotors in terms of energy densities</sentence>.</paragraph>

<paragraph>    <sentence>We have fabricated resonant structures on one micron thick silicon
nitride membranes which are able to spin two-millimeter diameter
rotors which are placed down on top</sentence>.  <sentence>Stator-rotor interaction is
achieved through frictional coupling and an inherent geardown creates
motors which run at low speeds with high torques</sentence>.</paragraph>

<paragraph>    <sentence>I will also discuss experiments with 8 mm diameter ultrasonic
motors fabricated from bulk ceramic PZT and an analysis of the contact
mechanics at the rotor-stator interface where the overall efficiency
of the motor is critically determined</sentence>.  <sentence>Models of line contact,
Hertzian contact and linear spring contact for Coulomb and viscous
friction have been derived and simulations will be presented which
predict speed-torque curves, efficiencies and overall output power for
various conditions of operating voltage and normal force</sentence>.</paragraph>

<paragraph>   <sentence>Work in progress on a new laser-etching technique for piezoelectric
ultrasonic micromotors offers promise for simplifying the fabrication
steps and developing more practical motors</sentence>. <sentence>We plan to incorporate
these actuators into small robots and create truly integrated
intelligent machines</sentence>.  <sentence>Presently, we are developing small palm-sized
autonomous robots, using conventional electromagnetic motors, with
onboard computers and 18 sensors which can crawl through tubes, pick
up small objects and cooperate on tasks</sentence>.  <sentence>Later, ultrasonic motors
will be retrofit as they become available, enabling miniaturization</sentence>.
<sentence>I will show videotapes of these machines in a robotic ant colony and
as intestine crawlers for telepresence surgery</sentence>.</paragraph>
