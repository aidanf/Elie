<paragraph><sentence>Computing transitive closure and reachability information in directed
graphs is a fundamental graph problem with many applications</sentence>.  <sentence>The
fastest known algorithms run in $O(min(mn,n^{2.38})$ time, where $n$
is the number of nodes and $m$ the number of edges in the graph</sentence>.  <sentence>It
is often the case that the aim is to compute the size of the
transitive closure and the number of nodes reachable from certain
nodes rather than computing them explicitly</sentence>.  <sentence>Examples of potential
applications are database query optimization or optimizing
multiplications of large real-valued matrices</sentence>.  <sentence>We present an $O(m)$
time randomized algorithm that estimates the number of nodes reachable
from every node and the size of the transitive closure</sentence>.  <sentence>Another
ramification of our estimation scheme is a $\tilde{O}(m)$ time
algorithm for estimating sizes of neighborhoods in directed graphs
with nonnegative weights</sentence>.  <sentence>Our size-estimation algorithms are much
faster than performing the respective explicit computations and
improve significantly over previous estimation methods</sentence>.</paragraph>
