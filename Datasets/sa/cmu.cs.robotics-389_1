<paragraph><sentence>In many applications such as geometric modeling and data compression, 
there arises the need to construct sparse approximations to discrete 
or piecewise linear curves and functions</sentence>.
<sentence>We consider such approximations with respect to several distance measures:
the Chebyshev distance for functions, and the Hausdorff distance and
parametric distance for curves</sentence>.
<sentence>The parametric distance aims to eliminate the unintuitive consequences of
the Hausdorff distance arising from its treatment of a curve as a set of
points rather than as the locus of a point</sentence>.
<sentence>Intuitively, the parametric distance P(A,B) between two curves A and B
is the length  of the shortest leash required if you were to
walk along curve A, and your dog walked along curve B, without backing up</sentence>.
<sentence>We present efficient algorithms for several problems in this context,
and state some open problems</sentence>.</paragraph>
