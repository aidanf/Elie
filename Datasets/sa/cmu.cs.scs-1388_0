                              WHAT IS REASONING?
                          HEURISTIC SEARCH REVISITED

<paragraph><sentence>In  the  history of research on thinking two (or more) distinct traditions have
persisted</sentence>.  <sentence>One tradition, deriving from the study of language and logic, views
thinking  as  a form of logical and verbal reasoning</sentence>.  <sentence>The other, deriving from
the study of human problem solving, views thinking as a  process  of  heuristic
search  through  a mental representation of a problem situation</sentence>.  <sentence>The talk will
use recent findings from research on  human  thinking  to  review  the  present
status and future prospects within A.I. of these two paradigms</sentence>.</paragraph>
