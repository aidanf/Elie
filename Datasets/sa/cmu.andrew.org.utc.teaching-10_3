University Teaching Center
Seminars Series for Graduate Students
"Managing Current Courses, Anticipating Future Roles"

ABOUT THE SERIES

<paragraph>"<sentence>Managing Current Courses, Anticipating Future Roles" is a weekly series
of interactive seminars designed for graduate students</sentence>.  <sentence>On a pilot
basis for 1993-94, the Teaching Center will offer several  in-depth,
three-week modules and several one-session special topics on different
aspects of college teaching and learning</sentence>.  </paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>The modules provide an opportunity for sustained discussion of selected
topics because we ask you to make a commitment to attend 3 or 4 related
sessions</sentence>.  <sentence>This format allows you to try some different strategies and
then discuss how they worked with other participants</sentence>.  <sentence>Also, for some
modules we may ask you to bring some sample materials from your
discipline so that the applications can be most useful to you</sentence>.  <sentence>The
special topic format allows you to sample a combination of topics based
on your interest in different types of students, course formats, or
teaching styles</sentence>.  </paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>To facilitate discussion each session will have no more than 20
participants</sentence>.  <sentence>Some of the sessions may break into smaller groups to
accommodate the interests of people in different disciplines</sentence>. 
<sentence>Experienced TAs, faculty, and administrators will be present to
facilitate discussion at several sessions</sentence>.  </paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>You should pre-register for sessions of interest to you by using the
form included in this program description, or by contacting Michelle
Gregg-Rassau, at x2896 or mg2e@andrew.cmu.edu</sentence>.  <sentence>Please note that the
locations for Spring 1994 seminars will be announced at a later date</sentence>. 
<sentence>If you have questions about these seminars,  please contact Rea
Freeland, Associate Director, at x7981 or rf51@andrew.cmu.edu</sentence>.   </paragraph>
