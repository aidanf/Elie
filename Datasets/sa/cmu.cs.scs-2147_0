ARGUMENT AND ARBITRATION GAMES

<paragraph><sentence>We begin with two points about modeling reasoning that Herbert Simon
and Nicholas Rescher made well, but which were lost in the AI shuffle:
1) rational belief can be constructed by the right kind of
resource-bounded process; 2) dialectic is one of the right kinds of
process</sentence>.  <sentence>A protocol for disputation is essentially a model of an
automated reasoner's search procedure</sentence>.</paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>We describe programs and card games which model case-based legal
argument and reasoned settlement</sentence>.</paragraph>
