<paragraph><sentence>Structures of dynamic scenes can only be recovered using a real-time
range sensor</sentence>. <sentence>Depth from defocus  offers an elegant solution to fast
and dense range estimation</sentence>. <sentence>It is computational efficient as it
circumvents the correspondence problem faced by stereo and the feature
tracking problem involved in structure from motion</sentence>. <sentence>However, accurate
depth estimation requires theoretical and practical solutions to a
variety of problems including  recovery of textureless surfaces,
blur estimation, and magnification variations caused by defocusing</sentence>. 
<sentence>Both textured and textureless surfaces are recovered using an
optimized illumination pattern that is projected via the same optical
path used to acquire images</sentence>. <sentence>A prototype focus range sensor has been
developed that produces up to 512x480 depth estimates at 30 Hz with
an accuracy of 0.3%</sentence>.</paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>In addition to the above topic, I'll briefly summarize recent results
on diffuse reflectance and visual learning</sentence>.</paragraph>
