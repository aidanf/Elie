<paragraph><sentence>Canada is participating in the international Space Station
Freedom Program through the development and operation of
the Mobile Servicing System (MSS) which will play a critical 
role in the assembly, maintenance and servicing of the 
station</sentence>. <sentence>The MSS is a robotic system featuring a large
manipulator for large payloads and two smaller manipulators
for dextrous tasks</sentence>. <sentence>The MSS manipulators can be operated
either manually by astronauts or in automatic modes</sentence>. 
<sentence>Advanced control system features and stringent requirements
on performance and safety present technical challenges
for the design and development of the MSS control system</sentence>.</paragraph>
