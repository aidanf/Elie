 TOPIC: Redesigning the Classroom: Teaching and Technology
 	in Higher Education

<paragraph> ABSTRACT: <sentence>Not since the introduction of chalkboards in the 1800s has
 the classroom been so challenged in regard to its basic design and
 pedagogical setting</sentence>.  <sentence>Neither overhead transparencies nor TV monitors
 provide the kind of dynamic, interactive capabilities seen on today's
 high resolution monitors</sentence>.  <sentence>Indeed, it is precisely the evolutionary
 symbiosis of powerful computers and good software that today provides
 the first real challenge to the traditional classroom setting</sentence>.  <sentence>The
 presentation will discuss all aspects of educational computing as it
is currently evolving: its history and context, issues of
instructional design and evaluation, technical support and
administrative advocacy, and the "computational turn" that is
affecting every academic discipline</sentence>.  <sentence>Concrete examples from <speaker>Dr.
Cavalier</speaker>'s classes at Carnegie Mellon will conclude the presentation</sentence>.
<sentence>These examples include the use of interactive multimedia, a hypertext
syllabus to display and disseminate classroom materials, a
class-specific electronic bulletin board, and the potential
utilization of "Tele-profs" via network-based video mail</sentence>.</paragraph>

<paragraph>SPEAKER PROFILE: <sentence><speaker>Robert Cavalier</speaker> received his BA from New York
University and a Ph.D. in Philosophy from Duquesne University</sentence>.  <sentence>He has
taught philosophy at a number of colleges and universities and has
co-authored CAI programs for logic</sentence>.  <sentence>In 1987 he joined the staff at
Carnegie Mellon's Center for Design of Educational Computing (CDEC),
where he became Executive Director in 1991</sentence>.  <sentence>While at CDEC, he was
also co-principal in the 1989 EDUCOM award winner for Best Humanities
Software ("A Right to Die? The Case of Dax Cowart")</sentence>.  <sentence><speaker>Dr. Cavalier</speaker> is
currently affiliated with CMU's Center for the Advancement of Applied
Ethics</sentence>.  <sentence>He is also a member of Carnegie Mellon's Philosophy
Department where he teaches courses in Ethics</sentence>.  <sentence>His coursework forms
an R & D vehicle that is used to explore many aspects of educational
computing</sentence>.</paragraph>
