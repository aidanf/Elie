    Symbiosis between photogrammetry and image understanding

	<speaker>Dr. Chris McGlone</speaker>
	Fairchild Weston Systems

<paragraph>	<sentence>Photogrammetry and image understanding are complementary fields; 
image understanding is concerned with "what", while photogrammetry is 
concerned with "where</sentence>."  <sentence>While there has been some productive cross-
fertilization, there are many further possibilities for useful 
interactions</sentence>.  <sentence>This talk will outline some areas of image understanding 
where photogrammetric techniques could be useful, such as multiple image 
solutions and stochastic modeling, and similarly, some topics in 
photogrammetry where image understanding concepts could be applied</sentence>. <sentence>The 
eventual goal should be the tighter integration of both fields, looking 
beyond automating individual operator's tasks and emulating paper maps to 
new ways of obtaining, processing, and exploiting image information</sentence>.  <sentence>As 
an example of the integration of image understanding and photogrammetry, 
the use of snakes for automated image-map registration will be discussed</sentence>.</paragraph>
